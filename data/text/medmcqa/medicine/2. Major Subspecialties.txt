Cardiology focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels (the cardiovascular system). Cardiologists manage a wide range of problems, including coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis, angina, myocardial infarction), heart failure (systolic and diastolic dysfunction), valvular heart disease (stenosis, regurgitation), arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), congenital heart defects, pericardial diseases, and vascular diseases (hypertension, peripheral artery disease). Diagnostic tools include electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) to assess heart rhythm and electrical activity, echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart) to visualize heart structure and function, cardiac catheterization and angiography to visualize coronary arteries and measure pressures within the heart, stress testing (exercise or pharmacological) to evaluate for ischemia, and cardiac imaging (MRI, CT) for detailed anatomical assessment. Interventions include medication management (antiplatelets, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with angioplasty and stenting, pacemaker and defibrillator implantation, and, in some cases, cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting – CABG, valve replacement).

Endocrinology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the endocrine system, the network of glands that produce hormones. These hormones regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, growth and development, reproduction, and mood. Endocrinologists manage conditions such as diabetes mellitus (type 1, type 2, gestational), thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer), adrenal disorders (Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease), pituitary disorders (growth hormone deficiency, acromegaly, prolactinomas), parathyroid disorders (hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), and disorders of calcium metabolism (osteoporosis). Diagnosis relies on measuring hormone levels in blood and urine, performing stimulation or suppression tests to assess gland function, and imaging studies (ultrasound, CT, MRI) to visualize endocrine glands. Treatment often involves hormone replacement therapy (e.g., insulin for diabetes, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism), medications to suppress hormone production (e.g., antithyroid drugs for hyperthyroidism), or surgery to remove tumors.

Gastroenterology focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the digestive system, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), liver, biliary tract, and pancreas. Gastroenterologists manage conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticulitis, colon polyps, colorectal cancer, hepatitis (viral, autoimmune), cirrhosis, pancreatitis, and gallstones. Diagnostic tools include endoscopy (upper endoscopy, colonoscopy) to visualize the lining of the digestive tract and obtain biopsies, imaging studies (ultrasound, CT, MRI) to assess the organs, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to visualize the bile ducts and pancreatic duct, and liver function tests. Treatments include medication management (acid suppressants, anti-inflammatories, immunosuppressants), endoscopic procedures (polypectomy, stricture dilation, variceal banding), and, in some cases, surgery.

Hematology deals with diseases of the blood and bone marrow. This includes both benign and malignant conditions. Hematologists manage anemias (iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, hemolytic anemias), bleeding disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease), clotting disorders (thrombophilia), and hematologic malignancies (leukemias, lymphomas, multiple myeloma). Often, hematology is combined with medical oncology as a single specialty (Hematology-Oncology). Diagnosis involves complete blood counts (CBCs), peripheral blood smear examination, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular diagnostics. Treatments include iron supplementation, blood transfusions, clotting factor replacement, anticoagulation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and bone marrow transplantation.

Oncology is the subspecialty focused on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Medical oncologists are physicians who specialize in the medical management of cancer, using chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and hormone therapy. Radiation oncology and surgical oncology are separate specialties, though cancer care often involves a multidisciplinary team. Diagnosis involves imaging studies (CT, MRI, PET scans), biopsy (tissue sampling for pathological examination), and tumor marker testing. Treatment decisions are based on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health and preferences. The field of oncology is rapidly evolving, with new targeted therapies and immunotherapies continually being developed.

Infectious Diseases specialists diagnose and treat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. They manage a wide range of infections, from common illnesses like pneumonia and urinary tract infections to complex and life-threatening infections like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, sepsis, and emerging infectious diseases. Diagnosis relies on identifying the causative organism through culture, microscopy, serological tests (detecting antibodies), and molecular diagnostics (PCR, sequencing). Treatment involves antimicrobial therapy (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, antiparasitics), guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Infectious disease specialists also play a crucial role in infection prevention and control, including antibiotic stewardship (promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics).

Nephrology focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the kidneys. Nephrologists manage acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), glomerulonephritis, electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and hypertension related to kidney disease. They also manage patients requiring dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis) and kidney transplantation. Diagnosis involves urinalysis, blood tests (BUN, creatinine, electrolytes), measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), kidney biopsy, and imaging studies (ultrasound, CT). Treatments include medication management (blood pressure control, diuretics, phosphate binders, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), dietary modifications, and renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation).

Pulmonology deals with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system. Pulmonologists manage conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – encompassing emphysema and chronic bronchitis –, pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusions, and sleep-disordered breathing (sleep apnea). Diagnostic tools include pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to assess lung volumes and airflow, chest X-rays, CT scans of the chest, bronchoscopy (visualizing the airways and obtaining samples), and thoracentesis (removing fluid from the pleural space). Treatments include inhaled medications (bronchodilators, corticosteroids), oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, mechanical ventilation, and, in some cases, lung transplantation.

Rheumatology focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases affecting the joints, muscles, and connective tissues (rheumatic diseases). Rheumatologists manage conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), osteoarthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and vasculitis. Diagnosis often involves a combination of physical examination (assessing joint swelling, tenderness, and range of motion), blood tests (rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibodies, antinuclear antibodies – ANA, inflammatory markers – ESR, CRP), and imaging studies (X-rays, ultrasound, MRI). Treatments include pain relievers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic therapies (targeting specific components of the immune system), and corticosteroids.

Allergy & Immunology specialists diagnose and treat allergic diseases and disorders of the immune system. This includes conditions like allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, food allergies, drug allergies, insect sting allergies, eczema (atopic dermatitis), and primary immunodeficiency disorders. Diagnosis involves allergy testing (skin prick tests, blood tests for specific IgE antibodies), pulmonary function tests (for asthma), and immunodeficiency workups (measuring immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte subsets). Treatments include allergen avoidance, antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids, immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual immunotherapy), and, in the case of immunodeficiencies, immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

Geriatrics is the subspecialty focused on the health care of elderly people. Geriatricians are physicians who specialize in the unique health needs of older adults, who often have multiple chronic conditions, take multiple medications (polypharmacy), and experience age-related changes in physiology. They address issues like frailty, falls, cognitive impairment (dementia, delirium), urinary incontinence, and functional decline. Geriatric care emphasizes a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which evaluates medical, functional, cognitive, and psychosocial aspects of the patient's health. The goal is to maintain independence and quality of life for as long as possible.

Palliative Care is a specialized area of medicine focused on improving the quality of life for patients and their families facing serious, life-limiting illnesses. It is not limited to end-of-life care and can be provided alongside curative treatments. Palliative care addresses physical symptoms (pain, nausea, shortness of breath), psychological distress (anxiety, depression), social needs, and spiritual concerns. The palliative care team typically includes physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other professionals who work collaboratively to provide holistic care. Advance care planning, including discussions about goals of care and end-of-life wishes, is an important component of palliative care.
