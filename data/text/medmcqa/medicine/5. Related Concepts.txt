Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. It integrates clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. EBM is not "cookbook" medicine; it requires a bottom-up approach that integrates the best external evidence with individual clinical expertise and patient choice. The practice of EBM involves several steps: Formulating a clear clinical question based on a patient's problem. This question should be specific and answerable, often using the PICO format (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). Searching for the best available evidence to answer the question. This typically involves searching electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library) for relevant studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines. Critically appraising the evidence for its validity, impact (size of effect), and applicability to the patient. This involves assessing the risk of bias in the studies, the precision of the results, and the relevance of the findings to the specific patient. Applying the evidence to the patient's care, taking into account their individual circumstances, values, and preferences. This involves shared decision-making, where the clinician and patient discuss the benefits and risks of different treatment options. Evaluating the outcome of the intervention and adjusting the approach as needed. EBM emphasizes the use of high-quality evidence, with a hierarchy of evidence that ranks different types of studies based on their rigor and risk of bias. Randomized controlled trials are generally considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, followed by systematic reviews and meta-analyses that synthesize the results of multiple RCTs. Clinical practice guidelines, developed by expert panels, provide recommendations for the management of specific conditions based on the best available evidence. EBM is a continuous process of lifelong learning and improvement, requiring clinicians to stay up-to-date with the latest research and to critically evaluate the evidence in the context of their own practice.

Clinical Reasoning is the cognitive process that underlies medical diagnosis and management. It is the thinking process that clinicians use to analyze patient information, generate hypotheses, make decisions, and solve clinical problems. It is not a single, linear process but rather a complex interplay of different cognitive strategies. Hypothetico-deductive reasoning is a common approach, where the clinician generates a set of hypotheses (possible diagnoses) based on initial information (chief complaint, history, initial examination findings) and then tests these hypotheses by gathering additional data (further history, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging studies). This involves deductive reasoning (reasoning from general principles to specific cases) and inductive reasoning (reasoning from specific observations to general principles). Pattern recognition is another important component of clinical reasoning, where the clinician recognizes a familiar pattern of symptoms and signs that suggests a particular diagnosis. This relies on experience and the development of "illness scripts," mental representations of diseases that include their typical presentation, pathophysiology, and management. Differential diagnosis is the process of considering all possible diagnoses that could explain a patient's symptoms and signs, and then systematically narrowing down the possibilities based on further investigation. Bayesian reasoning is a probabilistic approach to clinical reasoning, where the clinician estimates the probability of a particular diagnosis based on prior knowledge (pre-test probability) and new information (test results – likelihood ratio). This involves updating the probability of a diagnosis as new evidence becomes available (posterior probability). Clinical reasoning is influenced by various factors, including the clinician's knowledge base, experience, cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring bias, availability bias, confirmation bias), and the context of the clinical encounter (e.g., time pressure, patient factors). Effective clinical reasoning requires a combination of knowledge, experience, critical thinking skills, and metacognition (awareness of one's own thinking processes).

Patient-Centered Care is an approach to healthcare that emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting the individual patient's preferences, needs, and values. It places the patient at the center of the care process, recognizing them as a unique individual with their own experiences, beliefs, and goals. Key principles of patient-centered care include: Respect for patients' values, preferences, and expressed needs. This involves actively listening to patients, understanding their concerns, and incorporating their preferences into decision-making. Coordination and integration of care. This ensures that care is seamless and coordinated across different providers and settings. Information, communication, and education. Patients should be provided with clear, understandable information about their condition, treatment options, and potential outcomes. They should be empowered to participate actively in their care. Physical comfort. This includes pain management, attention to physical needs, and a comfortable environment. Emotional support and alleviation of fear and anxiety. This involves addressing patients' emotional concerns and providing support throughout their illness. Involvement of family and friends. Recognizing the important role of family and friends in the patient's life and involving them in care decisions, as appropriate. Continuity and transition. Ensuring smooth transitions between different care settings (e.g., hospital to home) and providing ongoing support. Shared decision-making is a core component of patient-centered care. This involves a collaborative process where the clinician and patient discuss the benefits, risks, and alternatives of different treatment options, and the patient makes an informed decision based on their values and preferences. Effective communication skills, including active listening, empathy, and clear explanations, are essential for patient-centered care. Patient-centered care has been shown to improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and health outcomes.

Preventive Medicine focuses on preventing disease and promoting health, rather than treating illness after it occurs. It encompasses a range of interventions aimed at individuals, communities, and populations. Primary prevention aims to prevent disease from occurring in the first place. This includes vaccinations (immunizations) to prevent infectious diseases (e.g., measles, polio, influenza, HPV), lifestyle counseling to promote healthy behaviors (e.g., healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, safe sex practices), and health education to raise awareness about health risks and preventive measures. Secondary prevention aims to detect disease at an early stage, when it is often asymptomatic and more easily treatable. This includes screening programs for various conditions, such as cancer screening (mammography for breast cancer, colonoscopy for colorectal cancer, Pap smears for cervical cancer, PSA testing for prostate cancer – although the benefits of PSA screening are debated), blood pressure screening for hypertension, cholesterol screening for hyperlipidemia, and diabetes screening for type 2 diabetes. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the impact of an established disease, prevent complications, and improve quality of life. This includes rehabilitation programs (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy) after stroke or injury, chronic disease management programs for conditions like diabetes, heart failure, and COPD, and support groups for patients with chronic illnesses. Preventive medicine also encompasses public health measures, such as ensuring access to clean water and sanitation, controlling infectious disease outbreaks, and promoting healthy environments. The goal of preventive medicine is to reduce the burden of disease, improve overall health, and increase life expectancy.
