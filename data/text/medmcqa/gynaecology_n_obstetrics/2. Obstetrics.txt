Normal Pregnancy and Prenatal Care involves understanding the profound physiological changes that occur in the mother and the developing fetus. Maternal adaptations encompass cardiovascular changes (increased cardiac output, blood volume, and heart rate; decreased systemic vascular resistance), respiratory changes (increased tidal volume and minute ventilation; decreased functional residual capacity), renal changes (increased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow), hematologic changes (increased plasma volume and red blood cell mass, leading to physiological anemia; hypercoagulable state), and endocrine changes (production of placental hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], human placental lactogen [hPL], estrogen, and progesterone). Fetal development progresses through distinct stages: the pre-embryonic stage (first 2 weeks after fertilization), the embryonic stage (weeks 3-8, characterized by organogenesis), and the fetal stage (week 9 to birth, characterized by growth and maturation). Prenatal screening and diagnosis aim to identify potential risks to the mother and fetus. Routine prenatal care includes regular visits with assessment of maternal blood pressure, weight, urine testing for protein and glucose, fetal heart rate monitoring, and assessment of fetal growth. Screening tests include ultrasound for fetal anatomy and nuchal translucency measurement, and maternal serum screening for aneuploidy (e.g., Down syndrome, trisomy 18) and neural tube defects. Diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis, are offered to women with increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities. Management of common pregnancy discomforts, such as nausea and vomiting (morning sickness), heartburn, constipation, back pain, and fatigue, involves lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication. Nutrition in pregnancy is crucial for fetal growth and development, with increased caloric and nutrient requirements (e.g., folic acid, iron, calcium). Exercise in pregnancy is generally recommended for healthy women, with benefits including improved cardiovascular fitness, weight management, and reduced risk of gestational diabetes. Preconception counseling, ideally before pregnancy, involves optimizing maternal health, addressing risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, medications), and providing education on healthy pregnancy behaviors.

High-Risk Pregnancy involves conditions that increase the risk of adverse outcomes for the mother or fetus. Preterm labor and birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include previous preterm birth, multiple gestation, uterine anomalies, and infection. Management involves tocolytic medications (to delay delivery), antenatal corticosteroids (to promote fetal lung maturation), and magnesium sulfate (for neuroprotection in preterm infants). Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Severe preeclampsia can lead to complications such as eclampsia (seizures), HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), and organ damage. Management involves close monitoring, antihypertensive medications, and delivery, with the timing of delivery depending on the severity of the condition and gestational age. Gestational diabetes is glucose intolerance that develops during pregnancy. It increases the risk of maternal complications (e.g., preeclampsia, cesarean delivery) and fetal complications (e.g., macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia). Management involves dietary modifications, exercise, and, if necessary, insulin therapy. Multiple gestation (twins, triplets, or more) increases the risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and other complications. Placenta previa is the implantation of the placenta over or near the cervical opening, which can cause painless vaginal bleeding. Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders involve abnormal placental adherence to the uterine wall, ranging from placenta accreta (adherence to the myometrium) to placenta increta (invasion into the myometrium) and placenta percreta (invasion through the myometrium). PAS disorders increase the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a condition in which the fetus does not reach its growth potential. Causes include placental insufficiency, maternal medical conditions, and fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Management involves close monitoring of fetal growth and well-being, and delivery may be indicated if fetal compromise is detected. Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), also known as stillbirth, is the death of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal medical conditions complicating pregnancy, such as pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, autoimmune diseases, and renal disease, require specialized management during pregnancy to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

Labor and Delivery encompasses the physiological process of childbirth. The first stage of labor begins with the onset of regular uterine contractions and ends with full cervical dilation (10 cm). It is divided into a latent phase (cervical dilation up to 6 cm) and an active phase (cervical dilation from 6 to 10 cm). The second stage of labor begins with full cervical dilation and ends with the delivery of the baby. The third stage of labor begins with the delivery of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta. Fetal monitoring during labor involves assessing fetal heart rate patterns to identify potential fetal compromise. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) can be continuous or intermittent. Pain management in labor is an important aspect of care. Non-pharmacological methods include relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and hydrotherapy. Pharmacological methods include epidural analgesia, which provides effective pain relief, and other options such as intravenous opioids. Induction of labor is the artificial initiation of labor, often using medications such as oxytocin or prostaglandins. Augmentation of labor is the stimulation of uterine contractions when labor has already begun but progress is slow. Operative vaginal delivery, using forceps or vacuum, may be indicated to assist with delivery in the second stage of labor if there is fetal compromise or prolonged second stage. Cesarean delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through an incision in the abdomen and uterus. Indications include fetal distress, failure to progress in labor, placenta previa, and previous cesarean delivery. Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is an option for some women with a previous cesarean delivery, but careful consideration of risks and benefits is required. Management of labor complications includes addressing shoulder dystocia (difficulty delivering the fetal shoulders after the head has delivered), which is an obstetric emergency, and postpartum hemorrhage (excessive bleeding after delivery), which can be life-threatening.

Postpartum Care involves the management of the mother and newborn after delivery. The postpartum period, also known as the puerperium, is a time of significant physiological changes as the mother's body returns to its pre-pregnant state. Involution of the uterus, lochia (vaginal discharge), and changes in the cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine systems occur. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is excessive bleeding after delivery (more than 500 mL after vaginal delivery or 1000 mL after cesarean delivery). Causes include uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract), retained placental tissue, lacerations, and coagulopathies. Management involves uterine massage, uterotonic medications (e.g., oxytocin, misoprostol), and, in severe cases, surgical interventions. Postpartum depression and other mood disorders, such as postpartum blues and postpartum psychosis, are common and require screening and management. Breastfeeding is recommended for its numerous benefits to both mother and infant. Lactation support should be provided to help mothers initiate and maintain breastfeeding. Contraception after pregnancy should be discussed with all women, and appropriate methods should be offered. Management of postpartum complications includes addressing wound infections, thromboembolism (blood clots), and mastitis (breast infection).
