Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (REI) focuses on the hormonal and functional aspects of the female reproductive system and the management of infertility. The menstrual cycle, a complex interplay of hormones, is central to understanding REI. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a pulsatile fashion, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH stimulates ovarian follicle growth, while LH triggers ovulation. The growing follicles produce estrogen, which prepares the endometrium for implantation. After ovulation, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which maintains the endometrium. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses, progesterone levels decline, and menstruation occurs. Ovulation induction is used to stimulate ovulation in women who are anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory. Medications used include clomiphene citrate (a selective estrogen receptor modulator), letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor), and gonadotropins (FSH and LH). Infertility evaluation involves assessing both male and female factors. Female factors include ovulatory dysfunction, tubal disease, endometriosis, and uterine abnormalities. Male factors include abnormalities in sperm count, motility, and morphology. Semen analysis is a key component of the male infertility evaluation. Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) encompass a range of techniques used to achieve pregnancy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) involves retrieving oocytes from the ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in the laboratory, and transferring the resulting embryos into the uterus. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) involves injecting a single sperm directly into an oocyte, often used for male factor infertility. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) involves placing washed sperm directly into the uterus, bypassing the cervix. Gamete (oocyte and sperm) and embryo cryopreservation are used to preserve fertility. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more consecutive pregnancy losses, has various causes, including genetic abnormalities, uterine anomalies, antiphospholipid syndrome, and endocrine disorders. Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as primary ovarian insufficiency, is the loss of ovarian function before age 40, characterized by amenorrhea and elevated FSH levels.

Benign Gynaecologic Conditions encompass a wide range of non-cancerous disorders affecting the female reproductive organs. Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumors of the uterine smooth muscle, often causing heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and pressure symptoms. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, commonly on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and pelvic peritoneum, causing pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial tissue within the uterine myometrium, often causing heavy menstrual bleeding and pain. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs on the ovaries, often asymptomatic but can cause pain or complications. Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is the descent of pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, rectum) into the vagina, often due to weakening of pelvic floor muscles and ligaments. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is any uterine bleeding that is abnormal in volume, frequency, regularity, or duration. Causes include structural abnormalities (polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis), ovulatory dysfunction, and coagulopathies. Chronic pelvic pain is pelvic pain lasting for more than six months, often with no identifiable cause. Vulvovaginal disorders include infections (e.g., candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis), dermatoses (e.g., lichen sclerosus, lichen planus), and vulvodynia (vulvar pain). Urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction are common conditions, often related to childbirth, aging, and other factors.

Gynaecologic Oncology deals with cancers of the female reproductive organs. Cervical cancer is largely preventable through screening with Pap smears and HPV testing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary cause of cervical cancer. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the stage of the cancer. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. It typically presents with postmenopausal bleeding. Treatment involves surgery (hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy), often followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer. Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, as early symptoms are often non-specific. Treatment involves surgery (cytoreductive surgery) and chemotherapy. Vulvar and vaginal cancers are less common and often associated with HPV infection. Treatment involves surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) encompasses a group of rare tumors that develop from trophoblastic tissue (the tissue that forms the placenta). It includes hydatidiform mole (complete and partial moles) and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (choriocarcinoma, invasive mole, placental-site trophoblastic tumor). Treatment involves evacuation of the uterus and chemotherapy for persistent or metastatic disease. Genetic predisposition to gynecologic cancers, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer) and Lynch syndrome (associated with increased risk of endometrial and colon cancer), is important to identify for risk reduction and screening. Palliative care is an essential component of gynecologic oncology, focusing on improving quality of life for patients with advanced or incurable cancers.

Urogynaecology focuses on disorders of the female pelvic floor. Urinary incontinence (UI) is the involuntary leakage of urine. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is leakage with increased abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing). Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) is leakage associated with a sudden, strong urge to urinate. Mixed incontinence is a combination of SUI and UUI. Overactive bladder (OAB) is characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia, with or without urge incontinence. Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), as described above, is a common condition. Voiding dysfunction includes difficulty emptying the bladder. Fecal incontinence is the involuntary loss of stool. Fistulas are abnormal connections between organs. Vesicovaginal fistulas are connections between the bladder and vagina, while rectovaginal fistulas are connections between the rectum and vagina.

Minimally Invasive Gynaecologic Surgery (MIGS) utilizes techniques to perform surgery with smaller incisions, resulting in less pain, faster recovery, and reduced scarring. Laparoscopy involves inserting a thin, telescope-like instrument (laparoscope) through small incisions in the abdomen to visualize and operate on pelvic organs. Hysteroscopy involves inserting a thin, telescope-like instrument (hysteroscope) through the cervix into the uterus to visualize and treat intrauterine pathology. Robotic surgery uses a robotic system controlled by the surgeon to perform laparoscopic procedures with enhanced precision and dexterity. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) involves performing laparoscopic surgery through a single incision, typically at the umbilicus. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) involves performing surgery through natural orifices (e.g., vagina, mouth), avoiding abdominal incisions. Surgical training and simulation are important for developing and maintaining surgical skills in MIGS.

Family Planning encompasses contraception, emergency contraception, and abortion services. Contraception options include hormonal methods (oral contraceptive pills, patches, rings, injections, implants), intrauterine devices (IUDs) (hormonal and copper IUDs), barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms), and sterilization (tubal ligation, vasectomy). Emergency contraception (EC) is used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. Options include levonorgestrel pills, ulipristal acetate, and copper IUDs. Abortion can be performed medically (using medications, typically mifepristone and misoprostol) or surgically (vacuum aspiration or dilation and evacuation). Counseling and shared decision-making are crucial for providing patient-centered care in family planning.

Adolescent Gynaecology focuses on the unique gynecologic needs of adolescents. Normal pubertal development includes thelarche (breast development), pubarche (pubic hair development), and menarche (onset of menstruation). Menstrual disorders are common in adolescents, including irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. Contraception and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention are important topics for adolescents. Gynecologic care of adolescents with special needs requires a sensitive and individualized approach. Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) can have significant impacts on reproductive health, including amenorrhea and bone loss.
