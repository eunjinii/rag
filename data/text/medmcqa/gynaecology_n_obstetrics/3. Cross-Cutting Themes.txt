Women's Health encompasses a broad perspective on health issues specific to women across the lifespan, extending beyond reproductive health. Preventive health care for women is crucial and includes regular screening for cervical cancer (Pap smears and HPV testing), breast cancer (mammography), and osteoporosis (bone density testing). Recommendations for screening vary based on age and risk factors. Menopause management involves addressing the symptoms and health risks associated with the menopausal transition, the cessation of menstruation. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats), vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances, and mood changes are common. Hormone therapy (HT) can be used to manage symptoms, but the risks and benefits must be carefully considered. Cardiovascular health is a major concern for women, as heart disease is the leading cause of death in women. Risk factors, prevention strategies, and treatment approaches may differ in women compared to men. Mental health in women is also a significant issue, with higher rates of depression and anxiety compared to men. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of increased vulnerability to mental health disorders. Violence against women, including intimate partner violence and sexual assault, is a major public health problem with significant physical and psychological consequences. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in screening for violence, providing support, and referring to appropriate resources.

Global Women's Health focuses on the health challenges facing women in low-resource settings and worldwide. Maternal mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high in many parts of the world, with the vast majority of maternal deaths occurring in developing countries. Causes include hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, infection, unsafe abortion, and obstructed labor. Access to skilled birth attendants, emergency obstetric care, and family planning services are crucial for reducing maternal mortality. Access to reproductive health care, including contraception, safe abortion services, and prenatal care, is often limited in low-resource settings, leading to unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Family planning in resource-limited settings faces challenges such as lack of access to contraception, cultural and religious barriers, and inadequate infrastructure. Obstetric fistula is a devastating childbirth injury, typically caused by prolonged obstructed labor, resulting in a hole between the vagina and bladder or rectum, leading to incontinence. It is most common in low-resource settings where access to obstetric care is limited. Gender-based violence is a widespread problem globally, with significant health consequences for women.

Ethics in Obstetrics and Gynecology involves navigating complex ethical dilemmas that arise in the context of reproductive health. Reproductive rights encompass the right to make decisions about one's own reproductive health, including whether or not to have children, the number and spacing of children, and access to contraception and abortion services. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical principle, requiring that patients receive adequate information about medical procedures and treatments, including the risks, benefits, and alternatives, and make voluntary decisions without coercion. Confidentiality is essential in healthcare, protecting the privacy of patient information. In Obs & Gyn, this is particularly important in sensitive areas such as contraception, abortion, and sexually transmitted infections. Prenatal genetic testing and counseling raise ethical issues related to autonomy, informed consent, and the potential for selective abortion based on fetal characteristics. Maternal-fetal conflicts arise when the interests of the pregnant woman and the fetus are perceived to be in conflict. These situations can be ethically challenging, requiring careful consideration of the woman's autonomy and the well-being of the fetus. Conscientious objection allows healthcare providers to refuse to participate in certain medical procedures, such as abortion, based on their personal moral or religious beliefs, but this must be balanced with the patient's right to access care.

Surgical Skills are very important in the field of Gynecology & Obstetrics. Principles of Electrosurgery in Gynecology & Obstetrics. This involves choosing between monopolar or bipolar energy. It also includes knowledge of different modes such as cut, coagulation, fulguration, and desiccation; as well as a discussion of the different waveforms. Surgical anatomy of the female pelvis; it is essential to develop an in-depth understanding of the anatomical relationship of the pelvic viscera, neurovascular structures, and pelvic sidewall. It is also important to master how to perform important steps such as: Developing the pararectal and paravesical spaces, ureterolysis, isolating the uterine artery, etc. Knot Tying involves mastering intracorporeal and extracorporeal knot-tying techniques is paramount for achieving secure hemostasis and tissue approximation during minimally invasive and open gynecologic surgeries. Proficiency in both one-handed and two-handed knot-tying methods, along with an understanding of knot security and appropriate suture selection, ensures durable repairs and minimizes complications. Suturing: different scenarios require different approaches. So a selection of appropriate suturing material is key, such as absorbable or non-absorbable, monofilament or braided. The second most important aspect is to select an appropriate technique: interrupted, continuous, running, locking, subcuticular, or figure-of-eight sutures. Lastly, understanding appropriate tissue handling is essential for a good end result. The ability to perform all the previous with accuracy is key for optimal wound closure, hemostasis, and tissue approximation in various gynecologic procedures. Safe Surgical practices are paramount. This encompasses meticulous preoperative planning, thorough understanding of patient anatomy, adherence to sterile techniques, and effective communication within the surgical team.
