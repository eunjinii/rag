Membrane Physiology governs the fundamental processes of cellular life by controlling the internal environment and communication with the external world. The cell membrane, a selectively permeable barrier, is primarily composed of a phospholipid bilayer, with the hydrophobic fatty acid tails facing inward and the hydrophilic phosphate heads facing outward. Embedded within this bilayer are various membrane proteins, which serve diverse functions including transport, signaling, and adhesion. Membrane transport mechanisms allow for the passage of molecules across the membrane. Passive diffusion, driven by concentration gradients, permits small, nonpolar molecules (e.g., O2, CO2) to cross the membrane directly. Facilitated diffusion, also passive, utilizes carrier proteins or channels to transport larger, polar molecules (e.g., glucose, ions) down their concentration gradients. Active transport, requiring energy (usually from ATP hydrolysis), moves molecules against their concentration gradients, using pumps like the Na+/K+-ATPase, crucial for maintaining ion gradients across the membrane. Osmosis is the passive movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that form pores, allowing specific ions to pass through. They are highly selective and can be gated (opened or closed) by various stimuli. Voltage-gated ion channels respond to changes in membrane potential, crucial for action potentials. Ligand-gated ion channels open or close in response to the binding of a specific molecule (e.g., a neurotransmitter). Mechanically-gated ion channels respond to mechanical forces. The membrane potential is the difference in electrical potential between the inside and outside of the cell. The resting membrane potential (RMP) is the membrane potential of a cell at rest, typically negative inside relative to outside, primarily due to the selective permeability of the membrane to potassium ions (K+) and the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. The action potential is a rapid, transient change in membrane potential, characterized by depolarization (membrane potential becoming more positive) followed by repolarization (return to RMP) and sometimes hyperpolarization (membrane potential becoming more negative than RMP). It's the basis of neuronal signaling. Depolarization is primarily driven by the influx of sodium ions (Na+) through voltage-gated Na+ channels, while repolarization is driven by the efflux of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels. Cell signaling involves the communication between cells, mediated by signaling molecules and receptors.

Cell Signaling enables cells to respond to their environment and coordinate their activities. Signaling molecules include hormones (acting over long distances), neurotransmitters (acting at synapses), growth factors (stimulating cell growth and differentiation), and cytokines (modulating immune responses). Receptors, typically proteins, bind to signaling molecules with high specificity. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of receptors that, upon ligand binding, activate intracellular G proteins, which in turn modulate the activity of effector enzymes or ion channels. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, phosphorylating tyrosine residues on themselves and other proteins upon ligand binding, initiating signaling cascades. Ion channel-linked receptors are ion channels that open or close in response to ligand binding, directly altering ion flow across the membrane. Nuclear receptors are located inside the cell (cytoplasm or nucleus) and, upon ligand binding (typically lipid-soluble hormones like steroids), translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. Signal transduction pathways are the intracellular cascades of events that occur after receptor activation. Second messengers, small intracellular signaling molecules, amplify the initial signal. Common second messengers include cyclic AMP (cAMP), generated by adenylyl cyclase, which activates protein kinase A (PKA); inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which releases calcium ions (Ca2+) from intracellular stores; and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates protein kinase C (PKC). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a crucial signaling cascade involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Signal amplification allows a small number of activated receptors to produce a large cellular response. Signal termination is essential to prevent overstimulation and maintain responsiveness to subsequent signals. Mechanisms include receptor desensitization, internalization, and degradation, as well as the inactivation of signaling molecules.

Muscle Physiology explores the mechanisms of contraction and force generation in different types of muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle, responsible for voluntary movement, is composed of multinucleated muscle fibers. Each fiber contains myofibrils, which are composed of repeating units called sarcomeres. The sarcomere is the basic contractile unit, containing thick filaments (primarily myosin) and thin filaments (primarily actin, tropomyosin, and troponin). The sliding filament theory describes muscle contraction: myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges, and then undergo a conformational change (power stroke), pulling the thin filaments past the thick filaments, shortening the sarcomere. Excitation-contraction coupling is the process linking the action potential in the muscle fiber membrane (sarcolemma) to the activation of contraction. The action potential propagates along the sarcolemma and into T-tubules (invaginations of the sarcolemma). This depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors, DHPRs) in the T-tubule membrane, which are mechanically coupled to calcium release channels (ryanodine receptors, RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR, the intracellular calcium store). Calcium release from the SR binds to troponin, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing cross-bridge cycling and contraction. Smooth muscle, found in the walls of internal organs and blood vessels, lacks striations. Its contraction is regulated by various factors, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and local factors. Smooth muscle contraction is generally slower and more sustained than skeletal muscle contraction. Calcium still plays a key role, but the mechanism differs. Calcium binds to calmodulin, activating myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates myosin light chains, enabling myosin to interact with actin. Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, shares features with both skeletal and smooth muscle. It is striated like skeletal muscle but has involuntary control like smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle cells are electrically coupled via gap junctions, allowing rapid spread of action potentials throughout the heart. The cardiac action potential is longer than that of skeletal muscle, with a plateau phase due to the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Muscle energetics involves the production and utilization of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. Muscle metabolism can be aerobic (using oxygen) or anaerobic (without oxygen). During intense exercise, when oxygen supply is limited, anaerobic glycolysis becomes the primary source of ATP, leading to the production of lactic acid.

Neuronal Physiology focuses on the electrical and chemical signaling properties of neurons, the fundamental units of the nervous system. Neurons are specialized cells that receive, process, and transmit information. They have a cell body (soma), dendrites (receiving input), and an axon (transmitting output). The axon hillock is the region where action potentials are typically initiated. Action potential generation and propagation, as described above, are crucial for neuronal signaling. The action potential is an all-or-none event; once the threshold potential is reached, a full action potential is generated. The refractory period limits the frequency of action potentials. Myelination, the wrapping of axons by glial cells (oligodendrocytes in the CNS, Schwann cells in the PNS), increases the speed of action potential conduction through saltatory conduction (the action potential "jumps" between nodes of Ranvier, gaps in the myelin sheath). Synaptic transmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other or with other cells (e.g., muscle cells). Chemical synapses, the most common type, involve the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron, which diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitter release is triggered by the arrival of an action potential at the axon terminal, leading to calcium influx and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) depolarize the postsynaptic neuron, increasing the likelihood of an action potential. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) hyperpolarize the postsynaptic neuron, decreasing the likelihood of an action potential. Electrical synapses involve direct electrical coupling between neurons through gap junctions, allowing rapid and bidirectional communication. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses. Major neurotransmitters include acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate (the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS), GABA (the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS), glycine (an inhibitory neurotransmitter), dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. Neurotransmitter receptors are specific for their respective neurotransmitters. Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, while metabotropic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. Sensory transduction is the process by which sensory receptors convert physical stimuli (e.g., light, sound, pressure, chemicals) into electrical signals. Receptor potentials are graded potentials generated in sensory receptors in response to stimuli. Neural coding refers to how the nervous system represents information about the intensity, duration, and location of stimuli. Mechanisms include firing rate (frequency of action potentials), the pattern of action potentials, and the specific neurons that are activated.
