Exercise Physiology examines the acute and chronic adaptations of the body to physical activity. Cardiovascular adaptations to exercise include an increase in cardiac output, due to increased heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume increases due to increased preload (Frank-Starling mechanism), increased contractility, and decreased afterload. Blood flow is redistributed to working muscles. Blood pressure increases, particularly systolic blood pressure. Respiratory adaptations to exercise include an increase in ventilation (breathing rate and depth) to meet the increased oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production. The ventilatory threshold is the point at which ventilation increases disproportionately to oxygen consumption, reflecting increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism. Muscle metabolism during exercise shifts from primarily aerobic at rest to a combination of aerobic and anaerobic during intense exercise. ATP production is increased to meet the energy demands of muscle contraction. Anaerobic glycolysis provides ATP rapidly but leads to the accumulation of lactate. Hormonal responses to exercise include increased levels of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), which stimulate glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen to glucose) and lipolysis (breakdown of fat to fatty acids), providing fuel for muscle contraction. Insulin sensitivity is typically increased during and after exercise. Growth hormone and cortisol levels also increase. Thermoregulation during exercise is crucial to prevent overheating. Sweating is the primary mechanism of heat dissipation. Heat production increases significantly during exercise. Training adaptations are the chronic physiological changes that occur with regular exercise. Cardiovascular adaptations include increased cardiac output, increased stroke volume, increased blood volume, and decreased resting heart rate. Muscle adaptations include increased mitochondrial density (enhancing aerobic capacity), increased capillary density (improving oxygen delivery), and hypertrophy (increased muscle fiber size).

Environmental Physiology studies the physiological adaptations of organisms to different environmental conditions. Adaptations to altitude involve responses to hypoxia (low oxygen availability). Acute responses include increased ventilation, increased heart rate, and increased erythropoietin (EPO) production (stimulating red blood cell production). Chronic adaptations (acclimatization) include increased red blood cell mass, increased capillary density in tissues, and changes in enzyme activity. Adaptations to heat involve mechanisms to dissipate heat and maintain core body temperature. Sweating is the primary mechanism of heat loss. Acclimatization to heat includes increased sweat rate, earlier onset of sweating, increased plasma volume, and decreased electrolyte concentration in sweat. Adaptations to cold involve mechanisms to conserve heat and maintain core body temperature. Shivering is a primary mechanism of heat production. Vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the skin reduces heat loss. Acclimatization to cold may involve increased metabolic rate and improved non-shivering thermogenesis. Adaptations to diving, particularly in marine mammals, involve mechanisms to conserve oxygen and tolerate high pressures. The diving reflex includes bradycardia (slowed heart rate), peripheral vasoconstriction (shunting blood to vital organs), and a spleen contraction (releasing stored red blood cells). Space physiology studies the effects of spaceflight on the human body. Microgravity (weightlessness) leads to a variety of physiological changes, including cardiovascular deconditioning (decreased cardiac output, orthostatic intolerance), bone loss, muscle atrophy, and fluid shifts.

Developmental Physiology examines the physiological changes that occur throughout the lifespan, from conception to old age. Physiological changes during embryonic and fetal development are profound, as organs and systems develop and mature. The placenta is the crucial organ for gas exchange, nutrient delivery, and waste removal in the fetus. Fetal circulation differs from postnatal circulation, with shunts (ductus arteriosus, ductus venosus, foramen ovale) that bypass the lungs and liver. Physiological changes during childhood and adolescence involve continued growth and development. Hormonal changes associated with puberty drive sexual maturation and secondary sexual characteristic development. Aging and senescence are characterized by a gradual decline in physiological function. Changes occur in most organ systems, including decreased cardiovascular function, decreased respiratory function, decreased renal function, decreased muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia), decreased bone density (osteoporosis), and changes in immune function. The mechanisms of aging are complex and multifactorial, involving cellular senescence, oxidative stress, and genetic factors.
