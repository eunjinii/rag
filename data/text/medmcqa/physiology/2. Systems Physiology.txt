Cardiovascular Physiology concerns the function of the heart and blood vessels, responsible for circulating blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients, and removing waste products. The cardiac cycle describes the sequence of events occurring during one heartbeat. Systole is the period of ventricular contraction and ejection of blood, while diastole is the period of ventricular relaxation and filling. The phases of the cardiac cycle include atrial systole, isovolumetric ventricular contraction, ventricular ejection, isovolumetric ventricular relaxation, and ventricular filling. Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute (CO = heart rate [HR] x stroke volume [SV]). Heart rate is controlled by the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic increases HR, parasympathetic decreases HR) and circulating hormones (e.g., epinephrine). Stroke volume is influenced by preload (the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole), afterload (the resistance against which the ventricles must pump), and contractility (the force of ventricular contraction). The Frank-Starling mechanism states that stroke volume increases with increasing preload (within physiological limits). Blood pressure (BP) is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the arteries. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the peak pressure during ventricular contraction, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the lowest pressure during ventricular relaxation. BP is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, hormones (e.g., angiotensin II, vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide), and local factors. The baroreceptor reflex is a crucial short-term regulator of BP, involving baroreceptors (pressure sensors) in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. Blood flow is determined by the pressure gradient and vascular resistance. Resistance is primarily determined by the radius of the blood vessels (Poiseuille's law). Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) increases resistance and decreases blood flow, while vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) decreases resistance and increases blood flow. Local control of blood flow involves autoregulation (intrinsic ability of organs to maintain constant blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure) and metabolic regulation (matching blood flow to tissue metabolic needs). The microcirculation (arterioles, capillaries, venules) is the site of exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and tissues. Capillary exchange occurs through diffusion, filtration, and reabsorption. Cardiovascular reflexes, in addition to the baroreceptor reflex, include the chemoreceptor reflex (responding to changes in blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH) and the Bainbridge reflex (increased heart rate in response to increased right atrial pressure). Hemostasis is the process of stopping bleeding, involving vascular spasm, platelet plug formation, and blood coagulation (clotting). The coagulation cascade involves a series of enzymatic reactions leading to the formation of a fibrin clot.

Respiratory Physiology deals with the processes of gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the body and removing carbon dioxide. The mechanics of breathing involve the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Inspiration (inhalation) is an active process involving contraction of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity and decreasing intrapulmonary pressure, drawing air into the lungs. Expiration (exhalation) is normally passive, driven by the elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall. Lung volumes and capacities measure respiratory function (e.g., tidal volume, vital capacity, total lung capacity). Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, tiny air sacs in the lungs, across the respiratory membrane (alveolar and capillary walls). Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli. Gas transport in the blood involves the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is affected by factors such as pH, temperature, and PCO2 (Bohr effect). Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in three forms: dissolved in plasma, bound to hemoglobin (carbaminohemoglobin), and as bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). The control of breathing is regulated by the respiratory centers in the brainstem (medulla oblongata and pons). Central chemoreceptors in the medulla respond to changes in PCO2 and pH of the cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies respond to changes in PO2, PCO2, and pH of the arterial blood. Ventilation-perfusion matching ensures efficient gas exchange by matching the amount of air reaching the alveoli (ventilation) with the amount of blood flow to the alveoli (perfusion). Mismatches can lead to hypoxemia (low blood oxygen). Acid-base balance is closely linked to respiratory function. The respiratory system helps regulate blood pH by controlling the level of carbon dioxide (a respiratory acid). Respiratory acidosis occurs when there is increased PCO2 (hypoventilation), while respiratory alkalosis occurs when there is decreased PCO2 (hyperventilation).

Renal Physiology encompasses the functions of the kidneys, including filtration of blood, regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, acid-base balance, and hormone production. Glomerular filtration is the first step in urine formation, where blood is filtered across the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's capsule. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of filtrate formed per minute. GFR is regulated by autoregulation (intrinsic mechanisms within the kidney) and extrinsic factors (e.g., sympathetic nervous system, hormones). Tubular reabsorption is the process of reclaiming substances from the filtrate back into the blood. Most reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule. Different substances are reabsorbed by different mechanisms (e.g., active transport, facilitated diffusion, osmosis). Tubular secretion is the process of adding substances from the blood to the filtrate. Secretion occurs primarily in the distal tubule and collecting duct. The regulation of water and electrolyte balance is a crucial function of the kidneys. Sodium (Na+) is the major extracellular cation, and its reabsorption is regulated by aldosterone. Water reabsorption is regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH increases the permeability of the collecting duct to water, allowing for water reabsorption and concentration of urine. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in regulating blood pressure and sodium and water balance. Renin, released from the kidneys in response to decreased renal perfusion, activates angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulates aldosterone release. Aldosterone increases sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys. Acid-base balance is also regulated by the kidneys, in conjunction with the respiratory system. The kidneys excrete hydrogen ions (H+) and reabsorb bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), helping to maintain blood pH within the normal range. Renal compensation for respiratory acidosis involves increased H+ excretion and HCO3- reabsorption, while renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis involves decreased H+ excretion and HCO3- reabsorption. Hormonal control of renal function includes the effects of ADH, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP, released from the atria in response to increased blood volume, promotes sodium and water excretion. Micturition is the process of urination, involving both involuntary and voluntary control.

Gastrointestinal Physiology focuses on the processes of digestion, absorption, and motility within the digestive tract. Motility refers to the movements of the gastrointestinal tract that mix and propel food. Peristalsis is a wave of coordinated muscle contractions that propels food along the digestive tract. Segmentation is a mixing movement that helps break down food and mix it with digestive secretions. The enteric nervous system, a complex network of neurons within the wall of the gut, controls motility and secretion. Secretion involves the release of various substances that aid in digestion. Saliva, produced by salivary glands, contains enzymes (e.g., amylase) that begin carbohydrate digestion. Gastric juice, secreted by the stomach, contains hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsinogen (which is converted to pepsin, a protein-digesting enzyme). Pancreatic juice, secreted by the pancreas, contains enzymes that digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats (e.g., amylase, trypsin, lipase), as well as bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) to neutralize stomach acid. Bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, emulsifies fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. Digestion is the breakdown of complex food molecules into smaller, absorbable units. Carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose). Proteins are broken down into amino acids. Lipids are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. Absorption is the uptake of nutrients, water, and electrolytes from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. Most absorption occurs in the small intestine, which has a large surface area due to villi and microvilli. Different nutrients are absorbed by different mechanisms (e.g., active transport, facilitated diffusion, passive diffusion). Hormonal control of gastrointestinal function involves various hormones, including gastrin (stimulates gastric acid secretion), secretin (stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas), cholecystokinin (CCK) (stimulates gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) (inhibits gastric acid secretion and stimulates insulin release). The gut microbiome, the community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays an important role in digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune function.

Endocrine Physiology studies the endocrine system, a network of glands that produce and secrete hormones, chemical messengers that regulate various bodily functions. Hormone synthesis, secretion, and transport vary depending on the type of hormone. Peptide hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon) are synthesized as preprohormones and processed into active hormones. Steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, testosterone) are derived from cholesterol. Amines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, thyroid hormones) are derived from amino acids. Hormones are transported in the blood, either free or bound to carrier proteins. Mechanisms of hormone action involve binding to specific receptors on target cells. Receptors can be located on the cell surface (for peptide hormones and catecholamines) or inside the cell (for steroid hormones and thyroid hormones). Receptor binding initiates signal transduction pathways, leading to cellular responses. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis is a central regulatory system in the endocrine system. The hypothalamus secretes releasing and inhibiting hormones that control the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary secretes hormones that regulate various target glands, including the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and gonads. The posterior pituitary releases hormones synthesized in the hypothalamus (oxytocin and ADH). Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) regulate metabolism, growth, and development. Adrenal hormones include cortisol (a glucocorticoid that regulates metabolism, stress response, and immune function) and aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid that regulates sodium and water balance). The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), which mediate the "fight-or-flight" response. Pancreatic hormones include insulin (lowers blood glucose) and glucagon (raises blood glucose), which play crucial roles in glucose homeostasis. Reproductive hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone) regulate sexual development, reproduction, and secondary sexual characteristics. Calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, and vitamin D. PTH increases blood calcium levels, while calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption from the gut.

Nervous System Physiology encompasses the functions of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, responsible for integrating and processing information. The PNS consists of all the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, connecting the CNS to the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system (controls voluntary movements) and the autonomic nervous system (controls involuntary functions). Sensory systems detect various stimuli from the environment and internal body. Vision involves the detection of light by photoreceptors in the retina. Hearing involves the detection of sound waves by hair cells in the cochlea. Touch involves the detection of pressure, vibration, and temperature by mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors in the skin. Taste involves the detection of chemicals by taste receptors on the tongue. Smell involves the detection of chemicals by olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity. Sensory transduction, as described above, converts physical stimuli into electrical signals. Motor control involves the planning and execution of movements. The motor cortex in the brain initiates voluntary movements. The basal ganglia and cerebellum play important roles in motor coordination and learning. The spinal cord contains motor neurons that directly innervate muscles. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and breathing. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during "fight-or-flight" responses, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and alertness. The parasympathetic nervous system promotes "rest-and-digest" functions, slowing heart rate, increasing digestion, and promoting relaxation. Higher brain functions include learning, memory, language, and consciousness. These functions involve complex interactions between different brain regions. Learning is the acquisition of new information or skills. Memory is the storage and retrieval of information. Different types of memory include short-term memory and long-term memory. Language involves the comprehension and production of spoken and written words. Consciousness is the state of awareness of oneself and the environment.

Immune System Physiology focuses on the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) and other foreign substances. The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the first line of defense, providing a rapid, non-specific response. It includes physical barriers (e.g., skin, mucous membranes), cellular defenses (e.g., phagocytes [macrophages, neutrophils], natural killer cells), and chemical defenses (e.g., complement system, interferons). Inflammation is a key component of innate immunity, characterized by redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Adaptive immunity is a slower, specific, and long-lasting response. It is mediated by lymphocytes (T cells and B cells). Humoral immunity involves B cells, which produce antibodies that bind to specific antigens (foreign molecules). Antibodies neutralize pathogens, opsonize them (mark them for destruction), and activate the complement system. Cell-mediated immunity involves T cells. Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) coordinate immune responses by releasing cytokines. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) kill infected cells. Immune cell development and activation involve complex processes. B cells develop in the bone marrow, while T cells develop in the thymus. Upon encountering their specific antigen, lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion (proliferation) and differentiation into effector cells. Cytokines and chemokines are signaling molecules that regulate immune responses. Cytokines mediate communication between immune cells, while chemokines attract immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation. Immune tolerance is the ability of the immune system to distinguish self from non-self, preventing autoimmune reactions. Central tolerance occurs during lymphocyte development, while peripheral tolerance occurs after lymphocytes mature. Immunopathology refers to diseases caused by dysregulation of the immune system. Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. Hypersensitivity reactions are exaggerated immune responses to harmless antigens (e.g., allergies). Immunodeficiency disorders result from defects in the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.
