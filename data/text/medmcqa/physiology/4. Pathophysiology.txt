General Pathophysiology encompasses the fundamental principles of disease processes at the cellular and tissue levels. Cellular injury occurs when cells are exposed to stressors that exceed their adaptive capacity. Causes of cell injury include hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), ischemia (reduced blood flow), physical agents (e.g., trauma, temperature extremes), chemical agents (e.g., toxins, drugs), infectious agents (e.g., bacteria, viruses), immunological reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, autoimmunity), genetic defects, and nutritional imbalances. Cellular adaptations are reversible changes in cell structure or function in response to stress. Atrophy is a decrease in cell size. Hypertrophy is an increase in cell size. Hyperplasia is an increase in cell number. Metaplasia is a change in cell type. Dysplasia is abnormal cell growth with altered size, shape, and organization (often precancerous). Cell death can occur through necrosis or apoptosis. Necrosis is uncontrolled cell death, often due to severe injury, characterized by cell swelling, membrane rupture, and inflammation. Apoptosis is programmed cell death, a tightly regulated process that eliminates unwanted or damaged cells without causing inflammation. Inflammation is a complex response to tissue injury or infection, characterized by redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function. It involves vascular changes (vasodilation, increased permeability), cellular events (recruitment and activation of leukocytes), and chemical mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, histamine). Acute inflammation is a rapid, short-lived response, while chronic inflammation is a prolonged response that can lead to tissue damage and fibrosis. Repair is the process of replacing damaged tissue with new tissue. Regeneration involves the replacement of damaged cells with cells of the same type. Fibrosis (scarring) involves the replacement of damaged tissue with connective tissue. Neoplasia is abnormal, uncontrolled cell growth, forming a tumor (neoplasm). Benign neoplasms are localized and do not invade surrounding tissues. Malignant neoplasms (cancers) invade surrounding tissues and can metastasize (spread to distant sites). Genetic disorders are caused by alterations in DNA sequence, ranging from single gene mutations to chromosomal abnormalities. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances can disrupt cellular function and organ system function. Dehydration is a deficiency of body water. Overhydration is an excess of body water. Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) can cause a variety of problems, including muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological dysfunction. Acid-base imbalances disrupt the normal pH of body fluids. Acidosis is a condition of low blood pH. Alkalosis is a condition of high blood pH. Respiratory acidosis and alkalosis are caused by changes in PCO2, while metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are caused by changes in bicarbonate concentration.

System-Specific Pathophysiology applies the general principles of pathophysiology to specific organ systems. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque (cholesterol, lipids, inflammatory cells) within the walls of arteries, narrowing the arteries and reducing blood flow. Risk factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes, and genetics. Atherosclerosis can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD), causing angina (chest pain) and myocardial infarction (heart attack). Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Causes include CAD, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It can damage blood vessels and organs, leading to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and other complications. Respiratory disease includes a variety of conditions affecting the lungs and airways. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, bronchospasm, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, often caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Renal disease can be acute or chronic. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden decline in kidney function, often caused by ischemia, toxins, or sepsis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. Causes include diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. Gastrointestinal disease includes a wide range of disorders affecting the digestive tract. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by ulcers (sores) in the lining of the stomach or duodenum, often caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or NSAID use. Endocrine disease involves dysfunction of the endocrine glands and hormone imbalances. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood glucose). Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Thyroid disorders include hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). Neurological disease encompasses disorders affecting the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Stroke is a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, causing brain damage. Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage in a blood vessel, while hemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor symptoms.
