Health systems encompass the organizations, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare services to a population. Different countries have adopted various models for organizing and financing healthcare. National health services (e.g., the UK's National Health Service) are publicly funded through taxes and provide universal coverage, with healthcare services generally free at the point of use. Social insurance systems (e.g., Germany) are funded through mandatory contributions from employers and employees, with insurance provided by sickness funds, which are non-profit organizations. Private insurance systems (e.g., the United States) rely on private insurance companies, with individuals or employers purchasing health insurance plans. Many countries have mixed systems, combining elements of different models. Healthcare access and equity are major concerns. Access refers to the ability to obtain needed healthcare services, which can be influenced by factors such as insurance coverage, geographic location, availability of providers, and cultural barriers. Equity refers to fairness in the distribution of healthcare resources and outcomes, addressing disparities based on socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender, and other factors. Healthcare quality and safety are critical for ensuring that healthcare services are effective, safe, and patient-centered. Quality improvement initiatives aim to improve the processes and outcomes of care, often using frameworks such as the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. Patient safety efforts focus on preventing medical errors and adverse events. The health workforce, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals, is a crucial component of health systems. Health workforce planning involves projecting future needs for healthcare professionals and ensuring an adequate supply and distribution. Training and education of healthcare professionals are essential for maintaining a competent workforce.

Health policy analysis involves the systematic examination of health policies, including their formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Policy formulation begins with identifying a problem or issue that requires policy attention. This may involve analyzing data, conducting research, and engaging with stakeholders. Developing policy options involves considering different approaches to addressing the problem, assessing their potential benefits, costs, and feasibility. Selecting a preferred option involves weighing the trade-offs between different options and choosing the one that is most likely to achieve the desired goals. Policy implementation is the process of putting policies into practice. This may involve enacting legislation, developing regulations, allocating resources, and engaging with stakeholders. Challenges to implementation can include resistance from stakeholders, lack of resources, and bureaucratic obstacles. Policy evaluation assesses the impact of policies on the intended outcomes. This can involve using quantitative methods (e.g., comparing outcomes before and after policy implementation) or qualitative methods (e.g., interviewing stakeholders). Evaluation findings can be used to inform policy modifications or future policy decisions. Stakeholder engagement is crucial throughout the policy process. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in or are affected by a policy. Engaging stakeholders can help to ensure that policies are relevant, feasible, and acceptable.

Health economics applies economic principles to the study of healthcare. The demand for healthcare is influenced by factors such as health status, income, insurance coverage, and prices. The supply of healthcare is influenced by factors such as the availability of healthcare providers, technology, and costs. Health insurance plays a major role in financing healthcare. Risk pooling is a fundamental principle of insurance, where the risks of high healthcare costs are spread across a large group of people. Moral hazard refers to the tendency for individuals to use more healthcare services when they are insured, as they do not bear the full cost of care. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher health risks are more likely to purchase insurance, leading to higher premiums for everyone. Healthcare financing involves the collection of funds to pay for healthcare services. Sources of funding can include taxes, mandatory contributions (e.g., social insurance), private insurance premiums, and out-of-pocket payments. Economic evaluation of healthcare interventions assesses the value for money of different interventions. Cost-benefit analysis compares the costs of an intervention to its benefits, both expressed in monetary terms. Cost-effectiveness analysis compares the costs of an intervention to its health outcomes, expressed in non-monetary terms (e.g., cost per life-year gained). Cost-utility analysis is a type of cost-effectiveness analysis that uses quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the measure of health outcome, reflecting both the quantity and quality of life.
