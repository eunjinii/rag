Descriptive Epidemiology focuses on characterizing the distribution of disease and health-related events in populations, describing patterns by person, place, and time. Key measures of disease frequency are incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates. Incidence quantifies new cases of a disease occurring within a defined population over a specific period, reflecting the risk of developing the disease. Prevalence measures existing cases (both old and new) within a population at a specific point in time or over a period, indicating the burden of disease. Mortality rates express the frequency of deaths within a population, and can be calculated as crude rates (overall death rate), age-specific rates (death rates within specific age groups), or cause-specific rates (death rates due to a particular cause). Morbidity rates refer to the frequency of illness or disease within a population. Analyzing disease patterns by person involves examining demographic characteristics like age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and occupation, identifying groups at higher risk. Place refers to geographic variations in disease occurrence, ranging from international comparisons to local variations within a community, which can provide clues about environmental or social determinants of disease. Time trends describe changes in disease frequency over time, such as seasonal variations (e.g., influenza), secular trends (long-term changes over years or decades), and epidemic curves (showing the distribution of cases during an outbreak). Surveillance systems are essential for monitoring disease occurrence and identifying outbreaks. Passive surveillance relies on routine reporting of cases by healthcare providers, while active surveillance involves actively seeking out cases. Outbreak investigation involves a systematic process to identify the source and mode of transmission of a disease, implement control measures, and prevent further spread. Steps typically include verifying the diagnosis, defining and identifying cases, describing the outbreak by person, place, and time, developing and testing hypotheses, implementing control measures, and communicating findings.

Analytical Epidemiology investigates the determinants of disease, aiming to identify risk factors and causes. Observational studies are used when researchers do not manipulate exposures. Cross-sectional studies assess exposure and disease status simultaneously, providing a snapshot of a population at a specific point in time, useful for measuring prevalence but not incidence. Case-control studies compare individuals with a disease (cases) to individuals without the disease (controls), looking retrospectively at past exposures to identify potential risk factors; they are efficient for studying rare diseases but susceptible to recall bias. Cohort studies follow a group of individuals (cohort) over time, assessing exposure status at the beginning and then tracking the development of disease, allowing for the calculation of incidence and relative risk, but can be expensive and time-consuming. Experimental studies, where researchers actively intervene, are considered the gold standard for establishing causality. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign participants to receive an intervention (e.g., a new drug or treatment) or a control (e.g., placebo or standard treatment), allowing for a comparison of outcomes between the groups. Community trials apply interventions to entire communities rather than individuals. Measures of association quantify the relationship between an exposure and a disease. Relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the incidence of disease in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group, used in cohort studies. An RR > 1 indicates increased risk, RR < 1 indicates decreased risk, and RR = 1 indicates no association. The odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls, used in case-control studies. It approximates the relative risk when the disease is rare. Attributable risk (AR) is the difference in incidence between the exposed and unexposed groups, representing the amount of disease in the exposed group that can be attributed to the exposure. Bias refers to systematic errors in a study that can distort the results. Selection bias occurs when the selection of participants into the study is not representative of the population of interest. Information bias occurs when there are errors in the measurement of exposure or disease. Confounding occurs when a third variable is associated with both the exposure and the disease, distorting the apparent relationship between them. Confounding can be controlled for through study design (e.g., randomization, matching) or statistical analysis (e.g., stratification, regression). Establishing causality, demonstrating that an exposure causes a disease, is challenging. The Bradford Hill criteria, a set of guidelines, are often used to assess causality: strength of association, consistency (replication in different studies), specificity (exposure associated with a specific disease), temporality (exposure precedes disease), biological gradient (dose-response relationship), plausibility (biological mechanism), coherence (consistency with existing knowledge), experiment (evidence from experimental studies), and analogy (similar exposures cause similar diseases).

Clinical Epidemiology applies epidemiological principles to clinical practice, focusing on diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effectiveness. Evaluating diagnostic tests involves assessing their accuracy in identifying individuals with and without the disease. Sensitivity is the probability that a test is positive in individuals who have the disease (true positive rate). Specificity is the probability that a test is negative in individuals who do not have the disease (true negative rate). Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that an individual with a negative test result does not have the disease. Likelihood ratios combine sensitivity and specificity to indicate how much more likely a test result is in individuals with the disease compared to those without the disease. Prognosis refers to predicting the likely course and outcome of a disease. Survival analysis is often used to estimate the probability of survival over time. Treatment effectiveness is evaluated through clinical trials, particularly randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs compare the outcomes of patients receiving a new treatment to those receiving a standard treatment or placebo. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) involves integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values to make clinical decisions. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses synthesize the results of multiple studies to provide a comprehensive assessment of the evidence. Decision analysis uses quantitative methods to weigh the benefits and risks of different diagnostic or treatment options. Cost-effectiveness analysis compares the costs and health outcomes of different interventions.
