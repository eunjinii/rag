Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are long-lasting conditions that are not caused by infectious agents. They are the leading cause of death and disability globally, accounting for the majority of deaths worldwide. Major NCDs include cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma), and diabetes. Risk factor identification is crucial for NCD prevention and control. Modifiable risk factors are behaviors or exposures that can be changed to reduce the risk of NCDs. Key modifiable risk factors include tobacco use, unhealthy diet (high in saturated and trans fats, salt, and sugar, and low in fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, harmful alcohol use, and overweight/obesity. Non-modifiable risk factors are factors that cannot be changed, such as age, sex, and genetics. However, even with non-modifiable risk factors, addressing modifiable risk factors can significantly reduce the risk of NCDs.

Risk factor modification involves interventions to reduce exposure to modifiable risk factors. Population-level interventions aim to reduce risk factors across the entire population. These can include policies such as tobacco taxes, restrictions on alcohol advertising, regulations on food labeling, and creating environments that promote physical activity. Individual-level interventions target individuals at high risk of NCDs. These can include counseling on healthy lifestyle choices, smoking cessation programs, weight management programs, and medication to manage risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

Screening programs aim to detect NCDs or their risk factors early, when treatment is more likely to be effective. Screening involves testing individuals who do not have symptoms of the disease to identify those who may have the condition or be at high risk. Examples of screening programs include blood pressure screening for hypertension, blood glucose screening for diabetes, cervical cancer screening (Pap smears), breast cancer screening (mammography), and colorectal cancer screening (colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing). Screening programs must be carefully evaluated to ensure that the benefits (e.g., early detection and treatment) outweigh the harms (e.g., false positives, overdiagnosis, anxiety).

Chronic disease management involves providing ongoing care for individuals with NCDs to control symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life. This can involve medication, lifestyle modifications, self-management education, and regular monitoring. Integrated care, coordinating care across different healthcare providers and settings, is important for managing NCDs, which often require long-term care and multiple interventions. The chronic care model is a framework for improving the quality of care for individuals with chronic conditions, emphasizing patient-centered care, proactive management, and self-management support.

Prevention of NCDs is a key public health priority. Primary prevention aims to prevent the development of NCDs by reducing exposure to risk factors. Secondary prevention aims to detect and treat NCDs early, preventing progression to more severe disease. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the complications and disability associated with NCDs. A "best buys" approach to NCD prevention and control focuses on cost-effective interventions that have a significant impact on reducing the burden of NCDs. These interventions often include tobacco control measures, salt reduction in processed foods, promotion of physical activity, and early detection and management of hypertension and diabetes. Addressing the social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of education, and inadequate housing, is crucial for reducing NCD risk and promoting health equity. Multisectoral action, involving collaboration across different sectors (e.g., health, education, agriculture, transportation), is needed to address the complex factors that contribute to NCDs. The WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs provides a framework for countries to develop and implement national NCD plans, with targets for reducing premature mortality from NCDs and addressing key risk factors.
