Public health nutrition focuses on the promotion of good nutrition and the prevention of nutrition-related diseases in populations. Assessment of nutritional status involves evaluating the nutritional health of individuals or populations. Anthropometric measures, such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference, are used to assess growth and body composition. Biochemical indicators, such as blood levels of nutrients (e.g., vitamin D, iron) and biomarkers of nutritional status (e.g., hemoglobin, albumin), are used to assess nutrient deficiencies or excesses. Clinical assessment involves examining physical signs and symptoms of malnutrition, such as wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age), and edema (swelling). Dietary assessment methods are used to evaluate food and nutrient intake. These methods include 24-hour dietary recalls (asking individuals to recall everything they ate and drank in the past 24 hours), food frequency questionnaires (asking individuals how often they consume specific foods), and food records (asking individuals to record everything they eat and drink over a specified period).

Nutritional deficiencies are a major public health problem, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency anemia, vitamin A deficiency, and iodine deficiency, can have serious health consequences, including impaired growth and development, weakened immunity, and increased risk of mortality. Macronutrient deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), can lead to wasting and stunting. Overnutrition, including overweight and obesity, is also a growing public health problem worldwide, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.

Interventions to address malnutrition can involve a variety of strategies. Food fortification, the addition of nutrients to commonly consumed foods (e.g., adding iodine to salt, adding iron to flour), is a cost-effective way to improve micronutrient status. Supplementation, providing specific nutrients in pill or capsule form (e.g., vitamin A supplements, iron supplements), can be used to address deficiencies in high-risk groups. Dietary diversification, promoting the consumption of a wide variety of foods, is important for ensuring adequate intake of all essential nutrients. Nutrition education, providing information and skills to improve dietary practices, is a key component of many nutrition interventions. Behavior change communication strategies are used to promote healthy eating habits.

Food security, access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life, is a fundamental requirement for good nutrition. Food insecurity, the lack of access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food, can lead to malnutrition and other health problems. Factors that influence food security include poverty, conflict, natural disasters, and climate change. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture, promoting agricultural practices that enhance the availability and consumption of nutritious foods, is an important strategy for improving food security and nutrition. Social safety nets, such as food assistance programs and cash transfer programs, can help to improve food security among vulnerable populations.

Nutrition throughout the life cycle has specific considerations. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is crucial for the health of both the mother and the infant. Infant and young child feeding practices, including breastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding, are essential for optimal growth and development. School-aged children and adolescents have specific nutritional needs to support growth and development. Older adults have increased risk of malnutrition due to factors such as reduced appetite, decreased mobility, and chronic diseases. Nutrition surveillance systems are used to monitor nutritional status and trends in populations, providing data to inform policy and program decisions. National nutrition surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States, provide valuable data on nutritional status and dietary intake. The integration of nutrition into health systems is crucial for addressing malnutrition. This can involve incorporating nutrition services into primary healthcare, providing nutrition counseling, and training healthcare providers on nutrition. Addressing the double burden of malnutrition, the coexistence of undernutrition (wasting, stunting, micronutrient deficiencies) and overnutrition (overweight, obesity) in the same population or even the same individual, is a growing challenge.
