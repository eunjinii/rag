Maternal and Child Health (MCH) focuses on the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and adolescents, recognizing the critical importance of these life stages for overall population health. Reproductive health encompasses a wide range of issues, including family planning, contraception, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and infertility. Access to family planning services allows individuals to make informed choices about the number and spacing of their children. Contraception prevents unintended pregnancies and reduces the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity. Prevention and treatment of STIs are crucial for preventing long-term health consequences and reducing the spread of infection. Infertility services provide support and treatment for couples who are unable to conceive. Prenatal care, the healthcare provided to women during pregnancy, is essential for ensuring a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Prenatal care includes regular check-ups, screening for complications, providing health education and counseling, and promoting healthy behaviors (e.g., good nutrition, avoiding smoking and alcohol). Early and regular prenatal care is associated with improved maternal and infant outcomes.

Intrapartum care, the care provided during labor and delivery, is critical for ensuring a safe delivery for both the mother and the baby. Skilled birth attendance, having a trained healthcare provider present at delivery, is a key intervention for reducing maternal and newborn mortality. Emergency obstetric care is essential for managing complications that may arise during labor and delivery, such as hemorrhage, obstructed labor, and eclampsia. Postnatal care, the care provided to mothers and newborns in the weeks following delivery, is important for monitoring their health and providing support. Postnatal care includes checking for complications, providing breastfeeding support, counseling on family planning, and providing newborn care education.

Child health encompasses a range of interventions to promote the health and well-being of children. Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases. Routine childhood immunizations include vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Child growth monitoring involves regularly measuring a child's weight and height to assess their growth and identify malnutrition. Early detection of growth faltering allows for timely intervention. Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is a strategy that addresses the major causes of childhood mortality, including pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, measles, and malnutrition. IMCI involves training healthcare providers to assess and manage these conditions effectively.

Newborn care is crucial for reducing neonatal mortality (deaths in the first 28 days of life). Essential newborn care includes immediate drying and warming of the baby, delayed cord clamping, breastfeeding initiation within the first hour of life, and assessment for signs of illness. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the newborn, is a beneficial intervention for preterm and low-birth-weight infants. Child development encompasses physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development. Early childhood development programs can promote optimal development and provide support for children at risk of developmental delays. Adolescent health addresses the specific health needs of adolescents, including reproductive health, mental health, and substance use. Adolescent-friendly health services provide confidential and accessible care that is tailored to the needs of adolescents.

Maternal and child health programs often involve a continuum of care, providing integrated services from preconception through pregnancy, childbirth, and childhood. These programs may include family planning services, prenatal care, skilled birth attendance, postnatal care, immunization, nutrition interventions, and early childhood development programs. Monitoring and evaluation of MCH programs are essential for assessing their effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. Key indicators include maternal mortality ratio, infant mortality rate, under-five mortality rate, immunization coverage, and prevalence of malnutrition. Addressing social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of education, and gender inequality, is crucial for improving MCH outcomes. Interventions that address these underlying factors can have a significant impact on maternal and child health. Health systems strengthening, improving the capacity of health systems to deliver MCH services, is essential for achieving sustainable improvements in MCH outcomes. This involves strengthening healthcare infrastructure, workforce, financing, information systems, and governance.
