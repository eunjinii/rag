Demography, the study of human populations, focuses on their size, structure, distribution, and changes over time. Population dynamics are driven by three key processes: fertility, mortality, and migration. Fertility refers to the number of births in a population. Key measures include the crude birth rate (number of births per 1,000 population), the total fertility rate (average number of children a woman would have in her lifetime), and age-specific fertility rates (birth rates for women in specific age groups). Mortality refers to the number of deaths in a population. Key measures include the crude death rate (number of deaths per 1,000 population), age-specific death rates (death rates for specific age groups), infant mortality rate (number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births), and life expectancy (average number of years a person is expected to live). Migration refers to the movement of people from one place to another. Internal migration is movement within a country, while international migration is movement between countries. Net migration is the difference between immigration (in-migration) and emigration (out-migration). Population growth is determined by the balance between births, deaths, and migration. Natural increase is the difference between births and deaths. The population growth rate is the overall change in population size, taking into account births, deaths, and migration. The age structure of a population, the distribution of people across different age groups, is often represented by a population pyramid. A population pyramid with a wide base and a narrow top indicates a young population with high fertility, while a pyramid with a narrow base and a wider top indicates an aging population with low fertility. Demographic transition is a model that describes the historical shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates, typically associated with economic development and social changes. The demographic transition typically involves several stages: high stationary (high birth and death rates), early expanding (high birth rates, declining death rates), late expanding (declining birth and death rates), low stationary (low birth and death rates), and declining (death rates exceeding birth rates).

Vital statistics are data on vital events, such as births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. These data are essential for demographic analysis and public health planning. Vital registration systems are used to collect data on vital events. These systems typically involve the registration of births, deaths, and other vital events with government authorities. Civil registration is the continuous, permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events. Census data, collected through periodic enumerations of the population, provide information on population size, age structure, sex ratio, and other demographic characteristics. Sample surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), collect data from a representative sample of the population, providing information on a wide range of health and demographic indicators. Demographic data sources are used to calculate various demographic indicators, such as birth rates, death rates, fertility rates, life expectancy, and migration rates. These indicators are used to monitor population trends, assess health status, and inform policy decisions. Population projections are estimates of future population size and structure, based on assumptions about future trends in fertility, mortality, and migration. Population projections are used for planning purposes, such as projecting future needs for healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Demographic analysis techniques are used to study population trends and patterns. These techniques include age-sex composition analysis, cohort analysis (following a group of people born in the same period over time), and life table analysis (estimating life expectancy and other mortality measures). Understanding demographic trends and patterns is crucial for public health planning and policy development. Demographic factors influence health outcomes, healthcare needs, and the demand for social services. Demographic data are used to identify health disparities, target interventions, and evaluate the effectiveness of public health programs.
