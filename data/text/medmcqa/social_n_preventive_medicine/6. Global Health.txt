The global burden of disease refers to the impact of health problems on populations worldwide, measured using various indicators. Communicable diseases, caused by infectious agents, remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. HIV/AIDS, a viral infection that weakens the immune system, continues to be a global pandemic, with significant progress made in prevention and treatment but ongoing challenges in achieving universal access to care. Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs, is a leading cause of death from infectious diseases, with drug-resistant TB posing a growing threat. Malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes, causes significant illness and death, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), a group of parasitic and bacterial diseases affecting primarily the poorest populations, often receive less attention but cause significant disability and suffering. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), chronic conditions not caused by infectious agents, are the leading cause of death globally. Cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke) are the most common NCDs, followed by cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. Risk factors for NCDs include tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and harmful alcohol use. Maternal and child health is a critical area of global health focus. Maternal mortality, the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period, remains unacceptably high in many low-income countries, often due to preventable causes such as hemorrhage, infection, and unsafe abortion. Infant mortality, the death of a child under one year of age, and child mortality, the death of a child under five years of age, are also significantly higher in low-income countries, often due to preventable causes such as infectious diseases, malnutrition, and lack of access to basic healthcare. Injuries, both unintentional (e.g., road traffic accidents, falls, burns) and intentional (e.g., violence, self-harm), are a significant cause of death and disability worldwide.

International health organizations play a crucial role in addressing global health challenges. The World Health Organization (WHO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, is the leading international health authority, setting global health priorities, providing technical assistance to countries, coordinating international health responses, and developing health guidelines and standards. UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) focuses on promoting the health and well-being of children worldwide, with programs addressing maternal and child health, nutrition, immunization, and education. The World Bank provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries, including investments in health systems and programs. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as Doctors Without Borders, CARE, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, play a significant role in implementing health programs, advocating for health policies, and providing humanitarian assistance.

Global health faces numerous challenges. Health inequities, disparities in health outcomes between and within countries, are a major concern. These inequities are often linked to social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of education, inadequate housing, and discrimination. Emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19, pose a constant threat, with the potential to cause pandemics that can spread rapidly across borders. Antimicrobial resistance, the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, is a growing global threat, making infections more difficult to treat. Climate change is increasingly recognized as a major health threat, with impacts such as increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves, extreme weather events, air pollution, and changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases. Health systems strengthening, improving the capacity of health systems in low-resource settings, is essential for achieving universal health coverage and addressing global health challenges. This involves strengthening healthcare infrastructure, workforce, financing, information systems, and governance. Addressing the social determinants of health, the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, is crucial for reducing health inequities and improving overall population health. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015, include a specific goal on health (SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), with targets related to reducing maternal and child mortality, ending epidemics of major communicable diseases, achieving universal health coverage, and addressing other health priorities.
