Air quality is a major environmental health concern, with air pollution contributing to a range of adverse health effects. Key air pollutants include particulate matter (PM), a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, categorized by size (PM10, PM2.5), with smaller particles penetrating deeper into the respiratory system. Ozone (O3), a secondary pollutant formed from reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight, is a respiratory irritant. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), primarily from combustion processes, contribute to smog and acid rain and can irritate the respiratory system. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), primarily from burning fossil fuels containing sulfur, can also irritate the respiratory system and contribute to acid rain. Carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion, reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Health effects of air pollution include respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), cardiovascular diseases (heart attacks, strokes), and lung cancer. Air quality monitoring involves measuring the concentrations of pollutants in the air using a network of monitoring stations. Air pollution control strategies aim to reduce emissions from various sources. Regulatory approaches, such as the Clean Air Act in the United States, set standards for air quality and emission limits for industries and vehicles. Technological approaches include using cleaner fuels, installing pollution control devices (e.g., scrubbers, catalytic converters), and promoting energy efficiency.

Water quality is essential for human health, and contaminated water can transmit a variety of diseases. Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli), viruses (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus), and protozoa (e.g., Giardia, Cryptosporidium). These pathogens can cause a range of gastrointestinal illnesses, from mild diarrhea to severe dehydration and death. Water contaminants can be microbiological (pathogens), chemical (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals), or radiological (e.g., radon, uranium). Water treatment processes aim to remove contaminants and make water safe for drinking. These processes typically involve coagulation and flocculation (removing suspended particles), sedimentation (allowing particles to settle), filtration (removing remaining particles), and disinfection (killing pathogens, usually with chlorine, chloramine, ozone, or ultraviolet light). Water safety regulations, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act in the United States, set standards for drinking water quality and require regular monitoring and testing. Source water protection, preventing contamination of water sources (rivers, lakes, groundwater), is also crucial.

Occupational health focuses on the health and safety of workers in the workplace. Occupational hazards can be chemical (e.g., solvents, asbestos, heavy metals), physical (e.g., noise, vibration, radiation, extreme temperatures), biological (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi), ergonomic (e.g., repetitive motions, awkward postures, heavy lifting), and psychosocial (e.g., stress, workplace violence, harassment). Workplace safety regulations, such as those enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, set standards for workplace hazards and require employers to provide a safe working environment. Safety programs, including training, hazard identification, and control measures, are essential for preventing workplace injuries and illnesses. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as respirators, gloves, and safety glasses, provides a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Occupational diseases are illnesses caused by exposure to workplace hazards. Examples include asbestosis (lung disease caused by asbestos exposure), silicosis (lung disease caused by silica dust exposure), carpal tunnel syndrome (nerve compression in the wrist caused by repetitive motions), and hearing loss (caused by noise exposure). Workers' compensation systems provide medical benefits and wage replacement to workers who are injured or become ill as a result of their job. Industrial hygiene involves the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of workplace hazards. Exposure assessment measures the levels of hazards in the workplace, and risk assessment evaluates the likelihood and severity of adverse health effects.

Food safety is concerned with preventing foodborne illnesses. Foodborne illnesses are caused by consuming contaminated food or beverages. Common pathogens include Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli, Campylobacter, and norovirus. Food contamination can occur at any point in the food chain, from production to consumption. Contamination can be microbiological (pathogens), chemical (e.g., pesticides, toxins), or physical (e.g., foreign objects). Food safety regulations, such as those enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the United States, set standards for food production, processing, and handling. HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a systematic approach to food safety that identifies potential hazards and establishes control measures at critical points in the food production process. Food inspection involves monitoring food production and processing facilities to ensure compliance with safety regulations. Food safety practices, such as proper handwashing, cooking food to safe temperatures, and storing food properly, are crucial for preventing foodborne illnesses.

Waste management is concerned with safe and effective collection, transport, treatment, disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Solid waste management is handled with landfills, incinerators, composting, recycling. Hazardous waste disposal needs specific care, for example, chemical waste needs proper labeling, storage, transport, and disposal methods. Vector control aims at controlling the spread of disease by controlling vector populations. Examples include: mosquito control to prevent malaria, dengue. Zoonotic diseases, that spread from animals to human also fall under waste management and require control strategies. The general principles involve reducing human exposure, controlling and reducing pollutants and risks. Exposure assessment, risk management, risk reduction are key.
