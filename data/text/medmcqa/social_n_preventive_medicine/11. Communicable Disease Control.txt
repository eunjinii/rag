Communicable disease control focuses on preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases in populations. The principles of infectious disease control are based on understanding the chain of infection, which involves a susceptible host, an infectious agent, a reservoir (where the agent lives and multiplies), a portal of exit (how the agent leaves the reservoir), a mode of transmission (how the agent is transmitted to a new host), and a portal of entry (how the agent enters the new host). Interventions can target any link in the chain of infection. Primary prevention aims to prevent new infections from occurring. This can involve measures such as vaccination, improving sanitation and hygiene, promoting safe sexual practices, and controlling vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks). Secondary prevention aims to detect and treat infections early, preventing progression to more severe disease and reducing transmission. This can involve screening programs, early diagnosis and treatment, and contact tracing. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the complications and disability associated with infectious diseases. This can involve providing appropriate medical care, rehabilitation, and support services.

Vaccination is one of the most effective tools for preventing infectious diseases. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against specific pathogens, providing protection against future infection. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficiently high proportion of the population is immune to a disease, protecting even those who are not vaccinated by reducing the spread of the disease. Vaccination programs require careful planning, implementation, and monitoring to ensure high coverage and effectiveness.

Outbreak investigation and response involve a systematic process for identifying, containing, and controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases. Steps typically include verifying the diagnosis, confirming the existence of an outbreak, defining and identifying cases, describing the outbreak by person, place, and time, developing and testing hypotheses about the source and mode of transmission, implementing control measures (e.g., isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, vaccination), and communicating findings. Surveillance systems are essential for monitoring disease occurrence and detecting outbreaks. Surveillance data can be used to track trends in disease incidence, identify high-risk populations, and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures.

Specific disease control programs target particular infectious diseases, often with tailored strategies. HIV/AIDS control programs focus on prevention (e.g., promoting condom use, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)), testing and counseling, and treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Tuberculosis (TB) control programs focus on early diagnosis and treatment of active TB cases, contact tracing, and preventive therapy for individuals with latent TB infection. Malaria control programs focus on vector control (e.g., insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying), early diagnosis and treatment with antimalarial drugs, and preventive therapy for pregnant women and children. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), a group of parasitic and bacterial diseases affecting primarily the poorest populations, require integrated control strategies, often involving mass drug administration, vector control, and improved sanitation and hygiene.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, is a growing global threat. Combating AMR requires a multi-faceted approach, including responsible use of antimicrobials, infection prevention and control, surveillance of AMR, and research and development of new drugs and diagnostics. Emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19, pose a constant threat, requiring preparedness and rapid response capabilities. International Health Regulations (IHR) provide a framework for international cooperation in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases across borders. The One Health approach recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, emphasizing the need for collaboration across sectors to address zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans) and other health threats.
