General Pathology forms the bedrock of understanding disease, encompassing the underlying causes (etiology) and mechanisms (pathogenesis) by which diseases develop. It delves into the fundamental structural and functional alterations that occur within cells, tissues, and organs in response to various injurious stimuli. This broad field is organized around several core principles. Cellular Injury is a central concept, exploring how cells respond to stress and noxious stimuli, ranging from adaptive changes (hypertrophy, atrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia) to irreversible injury leading to cell death (necrosis and apoptosis). Necrosis is characterized by uncontrolled cell lysis and inflammation, while apoptosis is a programmed, regulated cell death crucial for normal development and tissue homeostasis. The study of Inflammation, both acute and chronic, is paramount. Acute inflammation is a rapid response to injury or infection, characterized by vascular changes (vasodilation, increased permeability), leukocyte recruitment (neutrophils), and the release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins). Chronic inflammation, in contrast, is a prolonged response, often involving lymphocytes, macrophages, and tissue repair processes (fibrosis). Tissue Repair mechanisms, including regeneration (replacement of damaged cells with cells of the same type) and repair by connective tissue (scar formation), are essential for restoring tissue integrity following injury. Neoplasia, the process of "new growth," is a critical area of study, encompassing both benign and malignant tumors. Key distinctions lie in their growth patterns, differentiation, local invasion, and metastatic potential. Understanding the molecular basis of cancer, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and epigenetic alterations, is crucial. General pathology also addresses Hemodynamic Disorders, encompassing edema (fluid accumulation), hemorrhage (bleeding), thrombosis (blood clot formation within vessels), embolism (obstruction of vessels by detached thrombi or other material), and infarction (tissue death due to ischemia). Genetic and Developmental Diseases are also considered, examining the role of gene mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and environmental factors in causing congenital malformations and inherited disorders. Immunopathology involves diseases caused by abnormalities of immune system including hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmunity, and immunodeficiency. Finally, general pathology provides the foundational knowledge necessary to understand the pathogenesis of Environmental and Nutritional Diseases.

Systemic Pathology applies the principles of general pathology to specific organ systems, providing a detailed understanding of the diseases that affect each system. It bridges the gap between basic science and clinical medicine, allowing for a deeper understanding of the clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies for specific diseases. Cardiovascular Pathology focuses on diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), ischemic heart disease (angina, myocardial infarction), hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies (diseases of the heart muscle), and congenital heart defects. Respiratory Pathology covers diseases of the lungs and airways, such as pneumonia (infections of the lung parenchyma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, encompassing emphysema and chronic bronchitis), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and pleural diseases. Gastrointestinal Pathology examines diseases of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, biliary tract, and pancreas. This includes conditions like esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, hepatitis (viral, autoimmune, drug-induced), cirrhosis, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. Renal Pathology deals with diseases of the kidneys, focusing on glomerular diseases (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome), tubulointerstitial diseases, vascular diseases affecting the kidneys, and cystic kidney diseases. The pathology of urinary tract infections and urinary tract obstruction is also covered. Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Pathology, though often included with gastrointestinal, can be considered separately. It delves into the specific pathologies of the liver (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), gallbladder (cholecystitis, gallstones), and pancreas (pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer). Endocrine Pathology addresses diseases of the endocrine glands, including the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas (specifically the endocrine pancreas). This includes conditions like diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2), hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and various endocrine tumors. Neuropathology, covered separately in the anatomic pathology subspecialties, is an integral part of systemic pathology. It focuses on diseases of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nerves, including stroke, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, infections of the nervous system (meningitis, encephalitis), and peripheral neuropathies. Musculoskeletal Pathology examines diseases of bones, joints, and soft tissues. This includes osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, bone tumors (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma), soft tissue sarcomas, and metabolic bone diseases (osteoporosis, osteomalacia). Dermatopathology, also covered separately, is crucial for understanding skin diseases, including inflammatory dermatoses (eczema, psoriasis), infections (bacterial, fungal, viral), and skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma). Hematopathology, though categorized under anatomic pathology, has significant overlap with systemic pathology. It deals with diseases affecting the blood and bone marrow, including anemias, leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Reproductive Pathology covers diseases of the male and female reproductive systems. For females, this includes conditions like endometriosis, cervical dysplasia and cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, ovarian tumors, and diseases of pregnancy. For males, it includes prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer. Breast Pathology although part of reproductive pathology, is often considered independently due to its prevalence and specialized diagnostic approaches. It covers benign breast conditions (fibrocystic changes, fibroadenoma) and breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma). Each of these systemic pathology areas builds upon the fundamental principles of general pathology, providing the necessary framework for understanding the specific etiology, pathogenesis, morphological changes, clinical features, and complications of diseases affecting each organ system. This knowledge is crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and improved patient outcomes. A strong foundation in systemic pathology is essential for all medical professionals, regardless of their chosen specialty.
