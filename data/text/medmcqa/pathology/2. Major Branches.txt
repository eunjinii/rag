Pathology is broadly divided into two major branches: Anatomic Pathology (AP) and Clinical Pathology (CP), also known as Laboratory Medicine. These branches, while distinct in their methodologies and areas of focus, often collaborate closely to provide comprehensive diagnostic information.

Anatomic Pathology centers on the examination of tissues and organs to diagnose disease. This involves analyzing the gross (macroscopic) and microscopic (histologic) appearance of tissues, as well as employing advanced techniques like immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and molecular pathology. Surgical Pathology is a major subspecialty within AP, focusing on the examination of tissue samples removed during surgical procedures, such as biopsies and resections. This is a time-sensitive area, as the diagnosis often guides immediate surgical management and subsequent treatment decisions. The process involves gross examination of the specimen, followed by processing, embedding in paraffin, sectioning, staining (typically with hematoxylin and eosin â€“ H&E), and microscopic examination by a pathologist. Frozen section analysis, a rapid intraoperative diagnostic technique, allows for immediate assessment of tissue during surgery. Cytopathology is another key AP subspecialty that deals with the examination of individual cells, rather than tissue sections. These cells can be obtained through various methods, including fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of palpable masses or deep-seated lesions guided by imaging, and exfoliative cytology, where cells are shed naturally (e.g., Pap smears for cervical cancer screening). Cytopathology is less invasive than surgical biopsies and provides a rapid diagnostic tool, particularly useful for screening and for assessing lesions in easily accessible sites. Autopsy Pathology, also known as postmortem pathology, involves the examination of a deceased individual to determine the cause and manner of death. It encompasses both forensic pathology, which focuses on medico-legal investigations of death, and hospital autopsies, performed to understand the disease processes that led to death, contributing to medical knowledge and quality improvement. Autopsies involve a thorough external and internal examination, often including histopathology, toxicology, microbiology, and, in some cases, molecular analysis. Several subspecialties focus on specific organ systems or disease types. Hematopathology bridges AP and CP, specializing in the diagnosis of diseases of the blood and bone marrow, such as leukemias, lymphomas, and anemias. This involves bone marrow biopsies, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular diagnostics. Neuropathology deals with diseases of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves) and muscle, including brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuromuscular disorders. Techniques include histopathology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and molecular diagnostics. Renal Pathology focuses on the diagnosis of kidney diseases, primarily through kidney biopsies. It relies heavily on light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy (to detect immune complex deposition), and electron microscopy (to assess ultrastructural changes in glomeruli). Dermatopathology specializes in the diagnosis of skin diseases, utilizing histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and direct immunofluorescence. This is crucial for diagnosing skin cancers, inflammatory skin conditions, and infections. Pediatric Pathology is a specialized field focusing on diseases in infants, children, and adolescents. It requires a deep understanding of developmental biology and the unique diseases that affect this age group. Anatomic pathologists utilize a range of specialized techniques. Histopathology, the microscopic examination of stained tissue sections, remains the cornerstone. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) uses antibodies to detect specific proteins within tissues, aiding in tumor classification, identifying infectious agents, and determining prognostic and predictive markers. In situ hybridization (ISH) detects specific DNA or RNA sequences within tissues, useful for identifying viral infections, gene amplifications, and chromosomal translocations. Electron microscopy (EM) provides high-resolution images of cellular ultrastructure, particularly useful in renal pathology and certain tumor diagnoses. Molecular pathology techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are increasingly integrated into AP to detect genetic alterations, guide targeted therapies, and diagnose infectious diseases.

Clinical Pathology, or Laboratory Medicine, focuses on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.) and other specimens (e.g., bone marrow) to diagnose and monitor disease. This branch is highly automated and encompasses several key subspecialties. Clinical Chemistry involves the analysis of chemical components of blood and other body fluids. This includes measuring levels of glucose, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate), enzymes (liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes), hormones (thyroid hormones, cortisol), lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides), and other metabolites. Automated analyzers are used extensively to perform these tests, providing rapid and accurate results. Hematology focuses on the study of blood cells and coagulation. This includes performing complete blood counts (CBCs), which quantify red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; examining blood smears to assess cell morphology; and performing coagulation tests to evaluate blood clotting function. Automated cell counters and coagulation analyzers are essential tools in hematology. Medical Microbiology deals with the identification of microorganisms that cause infections. This includes culturing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites from various clinical specimens; performing Gram stains to classify bacteria; conducting antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic therapy; and employing serological tests (detecting antibodies to specific pathogens) and molecular diagnostics (PCR, sequencing) for rapid and accurate identification. Transfusion Medicine, also known as blood banking, is responsible for the collection, processing, testing, and transfusion of blood and blood products. This involves blood typing (determining ABO and Rh blood groups), antibody screening (detecting antibodies to red blood cell antigens), crossmatching (testing donor and recipient blood for compatibility), and preparing blood components (red blood cells, platelets, plasma). Ensuring blood safety and compatibility is paramount in this subspecialty. Molecular Diagnostics, while also utilized in AP, is a major component of CP. It involves using molecular techniques like PCR, sequencing, and FISH to diagnose genetic disorders, identify infectious agents, guide targeted therapies (precision medicine), and monitor minimal residual disease in cancer patients. This area is rapidly expanding and becoming increasingly important in all aspects of laboratory medicine. Clinical pathologists work closely with clinicians, providing crucial laboratory data that informs diagnosis, treatment decisions, and monitoring of disease progression. They also play a vital role in laboratory quality control and quality assurance, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test results. The integration of information from both Anatomic and Clinical Pathology provides a comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition, leading to optimal patient care.
