Surgical Pathology, the cornerstone of Anatomic Pathology, involves the examination of tissue samples removed during surgery, ranging from small biopsies to large resections. The primary goal is to provide a definitive diagnosis, which guides surgical management and subsequent therapy. The process begins with gross examination, where the pathologist describes the specimen's macroscopic features (size, shape, color, consistency) and selects relevant areas for microscopic examination. This is followed by tissue processing, which involves fixation (typically in formalin), dehydration, clearing, and embedding in paraffin wax. Thin sections are then cut from the paraffin block, mounted on glass slides, and stained, most commonly with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The pathologist then examines these stained slides under a microscope to evaluate cellular morphology, tissue architecture, and the presence of any abnormalities. Frozen section analysis is a crucial intraoperative technique, where a small piece of tissue is rapidly frozen, sectioned, and stained, allowing the pathologist to provide a preliminary diagnosis within minutes, often guiding the surgeon's immediate decisions during the operation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is frequently used to further characterize tumors, identify infectious agents, and determine prognostic or predictive markers. Surgical pathology reports provide critical information, including the diagnosis (benign or malignant, and the specific type of disease), tumor grade (degree of differentiation), stage (extent of spread), margin status (presence or absence of disease at the surgical margins), and any other relevant pathological findings.

Cytopathology focuses on the examination of individual cells, rather than tissue sections, obtained from various sources. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) involves using a thin needle to sample cells from palpable masses or deep-seated lesions guided by imaging (ultrasound, CT scan). Exfoliative cytology examines cells that have been shed spontaneously, such as in Pap smears (cervical cancer screening), sputum cytology (lung cancer detection), and urine cytology (bladder cancer detection). Body fluid cytology examines cells present in fluids like pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. The collected cells are processed, stained (often with the Papanicolaou stain), and examined under a microscope. Cytopathologists look for abnormalities in cell morphology, nuclear features, and cytoplasmic characteristics to diagnose malignancy, infections, and inflammatory conditions. While less invasive than surgical biopsies, cytopathology provides rapid results and is crucial for screening and diagnosing lesions in accessible locations. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular techniques can also be applied to cytological specimens, although the amount of material is often limited.

Autopsy Pathology, or postmortem pathology, involves the examination of a deceased individual to determine the cause and manner of death, and to evaluate any disease or injury present. Forensic pathology focuses on medico-legal cases, often involving sudden, unexpected, or violent deaths. Forensic pathologists work closely with law enforcement agencies and the legal system, providing expert testimony in court. Hospital autopsies are performed to understand the disease processes that led to a patient's death, contributing to medical knowledge, quality improvement, and education. The autopsy process involves a thorough external examination, followed by a systematic internal examination of all organ systems. Tissue samples are taken for histopathological examination, and additional investigations like toxicology, microbiology, and, in some cases, molecular analysis may be performed. Autopsies provide valuable information about the natural history of diseases, the effectiveness of treatments, and the presence of undiagnosed conditions.

Hematopathology is a subspecialty that bridges Anatomic and Clinical Pathology, focusing on the diagnosis of diseases of the blood and bone marrow. This includes benign and malignant conditions, such as anemias, leukemias, lymphomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Hematopathologists examine bone marrow biopsies and aspirates, peripheral blood smears, and lymph node biopsies. They utilize a combination of techniques, including histopathology (examining the morphology of cells and tissue architecture), flow cytometry (analyzing cell surface markers to identify and classify different cell populations), cytogenetics (studying chromosomes to detect abnormalities like translocations), and molecular diagnostics (detecting gene mutations and rearrangements). Accurate diagnosis and classification of hematologic malignancies are crucial for guiding treatment decisions and predicting prognosis.

Neuropathology specializes in the diagnosis of diseases of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), peripheral nerves, and muscle. This includes a wide range of conditions, such as brain tumors (gliomas, meningiomas), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), multiple sclerosis, infections of the nervous system (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), and neuromuscular disorders (muscular dystrophies, peripheral neuropathies). Neuropathologists examine brain and spinal cord tissue obtained through biopsies or autopsies, as well as muscle and nerve biopsies. They employ histopathology, immunohistochemistry (to identify specific cell types and markers), electron microscopy (for ultrastructural analysis), and molecular diagnostics (to detect genetic alterations in tumors and inherited disorders).

Renal Pathology focuses on the diagnosis of kidney diseases, primarily through the examination of kidney biopsies. This is particularly important for evaluating glomerular diseases (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome), tubulointerstitial diseases, and vascular diseases affecting the kidneys. Renal pathologists use a combination of light microscopy (examining H&E-stained sections), immunofluorescence microscopy (to detect the presence and pattern of immune complex deposition â€“ IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, fibrin), and electron microscopy (to assess ultrastructural changes in the glomeruli, such as basement membrane thickening or podocyte foot process effacement). These techniques allow for precise classification of kidney diseases, which is essential for guiding treatment and predicting prognosis.

Dermatopathology is the subspecialty dedicated to the diagnosis of skin diseases. Dermatopathologists examine skin biopsies, ranging from small punch biopsies to larger excisions. They diagnose a wide spectrum of conditions, including inflammatory dermatoses (eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus), infections (bacterial, fungal, viral), and skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma). Histopathology, using H&E and special stains, is the primary diagnostic tool. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to differentiate various types of skin tumors and to identify specific markers. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is employed to detect autoantibodies in autoimmune blistering diseases (pemphigus, pemphigoid).

Pediatric Pathology is a specialized field that focuses on the diagnosis of diseases in infants, children, and adolescents. This requires a unique understanding of developmental biology and the specific diseases that affect this age group, which differ significantly from those seen in adults. Pediatric pathologists diagnose a wide range of conditions, including congenital anomalies, genetic disorders, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, and childhood cancers (leukemias, lymphomas, brain tumors, sarcomas). They utilize histopathology, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and molecular diagnostics, often tailored to the specific needs of pediatric patients. The interpretation of pathological findings in children requires careful consideration of the developmental stage and age-related changes.
