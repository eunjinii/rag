Clinical Chemistry, a core subspecialty of Clinical Pathology, involves the analysis of the chemical constituents of body fluids, primarily blood (serum or plasma) and urine, but also cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, and others. This analysis provides crucial information for diagnosing and managing a wide range of diseases, including metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, organ dysfunction, and toxicities. Clinical chemists utilize a variety of automated analyzers that employ different analytical techniques. Spectrophotometry, a common method, measures the absorbance or transmission of light through a solution to determine the concentration of a substance. Immunoassays use antibodies to detect and quantify specific substances, such as hormones, drugs, and tumor markers. Electrophoresis separates molecules based on their size and charge, useful for analyzing proteins and isoenzymes. Point-of-care testing (POCT) devices allow for rapid analysis of certain analytes at the patient's bedside. Key areas within clinical chemistry include general chemistry, which measures common analytes like glucose (for diabetes), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate - for acid-base balance and hydration status), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (for kidney function), and liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT - for liver function). Endocrine testing measures hormone levels (thyroid hormones, cortisol, growth hormone, etc.) to diagnose endocrine disorders. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) measures drug concentrations in the blood to ensure optimal therapeutic levels and minimize toxicity. Toxicology identifies and quantifies drugs of abuse and other toxins. Lipid testing measures cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL) and triglycerides to assess cardiovascular risk. Clinical chemists interpret test results in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and other laboratory findings, providing guidance to clinicians for diagnosis and treatment.

Hematology focuses on the study of blood cells and coagulation. This involves evaluating the number, morphology, and function of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Complete blood counts (CBCs) are routinely performed using automated hematology analyzers, which count and differentiate blood cells based on their size and other physical characteristics. The CBC provides information about RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC), WBC count and differential (percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and platelet count. Examination of a peripheral blood smear under a microscope allows for assessment of cell morphology, identifying abnormalities like anisocytosis (variation in RBC size), poikilocytosis (variation in RBC shape), and the presence of immature or abnormal cells. Coagulation testing evaluates the blood clotting process. Key tests include prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which assess different pathways of the coagulation cascade; fibrinogen levels; and D-dimer (a marker of fibrin degradation). Hematology plays a crucial role in diagnosing anemias (iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, hemolytic anemias), bleeding disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease), thrombotic disorders (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), and hematologic malignancies (leukemias, lymphomas â€“ although definitive diagnosis often requires bone marrow examination, which falls under Hematopathology).

Medical Microbiology deals with the identification of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) that cause infections. This involves various techniques, including microscopy, culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, serology, and molecular diagnostics. Microscopy, often using Gram stain for bacteria, allows for rapid preliminary identification of microorganisms. Culture involves growing microorganisms from clinical specimens (blood, urine, sputum, wound swabs, etc.) on various culture media. Identification is based on colony morphology, biochemical reactions, and other characteristics. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing determines which antibiotics are effective against a particular bacterial isolate, guiding antibiotic therapy. This is typically done using disk diffusion or automated methods that determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic. Serology detects antibodies to specific pathogens in the patient's serum, indicating past or current infection. This is particularly useful for diagnosing viral infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis viruses) and some bacterial infections. Molecular diagnostics, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequencing, are increasingly used for rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms, particularly viruses and fastidious bacteria. These techniques can detect microbial DNA or RNA directly from clinical specimens, even if the organism is difficult or impossible to culture. Medical microbiology plays a critical role in diagnosing infections, guiding antimicrobial therapy, and implementing infection control measures.

Transfusion Medicine, also known as Blood Banking, is responsible for ensuring the safety and compatibility of blood and blood products for transfusion. This involves several key steps: donor selection and blood collection, processing of blood components, testing for infectious disease markers, ABO and Rh blood typing, antibody screening, and crossmatching. Blood donors are carefully screened to minimize the risk of transmitting infections. Collected blood is typically separated into components: red blood cells, platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitate. Blood is tested for various infectious disease markers, including HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, syphilis, and others. ABO and Rh blood typing are performed on both donor and recipient blood to ensure compatibility. Antibody screening detects the presence of unexpected antibodies in the recipient's serum that could react with donor red blood cells. Crossmatching involves testing the recipient's serum against donor red blood cells to confirm compatibility before transfusion. Transfusion medicine specialists also manage transfusion reactions, provide specialized blood products (e.g., irradiated blood for immunocompromised patients), and perform therapeutic apheresis (removing specific blood components, such as plasma or platelets).

Molecular Diagnostics, while also utilized in Anatomic Pathology, is a rapidly growing and increasingly important subspecialty within Clinical Pathology. It employs molecular techniques to detect and analyze nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) for various diagnostic purposes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences, allowing for detection of even small amounts of target DNA. Real-time PCR (qPCR) allows for quantification of DNA or RNA. DNA sequencing, including Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS), determines the nucleotide sequence of DNA, enabling identification of gene mutations, polymorphisms, and microbial strains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA sequences on chromosomes or in cells. Microarrays can simultaneously analyze thousands of genes or genetic variations. Molecular diagnostics is used in various areas, including infectious disease diagnosis (detecting viral load in HIV, identifying bacterial resistance genes), genetic testing (diagnosing inherited disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease), pharmacogenomics (predicting drug response based on an individual's genetic makeup), oncology (detecting tumor-specific mutations to guide targeted therapies), and hematopathology (identifying chromosomal translocations in leukemias and lymphomas). The increasing use of molecular diagnostics is revolutionizing many aspects of laboratory medicine, leading to more precise and personalized patient care.
