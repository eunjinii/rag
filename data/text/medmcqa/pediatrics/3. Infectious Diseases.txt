Common childhood infections are a frequent reason for pediatric visits and hospitalizations. Viral infections are the most common cause. The common cold, caused by rhinoviruses and other viruses, presents with nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and sore throat. Influenza (flu) is caused by influenza viruses and presents with fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue. Bronchiolitis, most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), affects infants and young children, causing inflammation of the small airways (bronchioles) and leading to wheezing and difficulty breathing. Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is characterized by a barking cough, stridor, and hoarseness, often caused by parainfluenza viruses. Gastroenteritis, causing diarrhea and vomiting, is often caused by rotavirus (vaccine-preventable) or norovirus. Varicella (chickenpox) is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by a vesicular rash. Measles, mumps, and rubella are also vaccine-preventable viral infections with potentially serious complications. Bacterial infections are less common than viral infections but can be more severe. Otitis media (middle ear infection) is often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcal pharyngitis ("strep throat") is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) and can lead to rheumatic fever if untreated. Pneumonia can be caused by viruses or bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in girls and are often caused by Escherichia coli. Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) can be caused by viruses or bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (less common due to vaccination). Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. Diagnosis of these infections often involves clinical evaluation, and sometimes laboratory testing (e.g., throat culture for strep throat, urine culture for UTI, blood culture for sepsis, rapid antigen tests for influenza and RSV). Treatment varies depending on the cause, with antibiotics used for bacterial infections and supportive care for viral infections.

Immunizations are a cornerstone of preventive pediatrics, protecting children from serious vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination schedules recommend the timing and number of doses for various vaccines. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine protects against these three viral diseases. The DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) vaccine protects against these three bacterial diseases. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) protects against polio. The Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccine protects against Hib infection, a major cause of meningitis in young children. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, including pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. The hepatitis B vaccine protects against hepatitis B virus infection. The rotavirus vaccine protects against rotavirus gastroenteritis. The varicella vaccine protects against chickenpox. The HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine protects against HPV infection, which can cause cervical cancer and other cancers. Vaccine safety and efficacy are rigorously monitored. Common side effects are usually mild (e.g., pain at the injection site, low-grade fever). Serious adverse events are rare. Contraindications and precautions to vaccination are specific to each vaccine and should be carefully considered. Management of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks involves identifying cases, providing treatment, and implementing control measures (e.g., vaccination, isolation).

Pediatric HIV/AIDS presents unique challenges. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is a critical priority. This involves providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to pregnant women with HIV, administering ART to the infant after birth, and avoiding breastfeeding (when safe and feasible alternatives are available). Diagnosis of HIV in infants and children can be challenging, as maternal antibodies can persist for up to 18 months. PCR testing for HIV DNA or RNA is used to diagnose HIV infection in infants. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the mainstay of treatment for HIV infection in children. Different ART regimens are available, and the choice of regimen depends on the child's age, weight, and other factors. Management of opportunistic infections is important, as children with HIV are at increased risk for infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis, and candidiasis. Psychosocial issues are significant, as children with HIV may face stigma, discrimination, and challenges related to adherence to medication and disclosure of their HIV status. Long-term management of HIV infection in children involves regular monitoring of viral load, CD4 count, and potential complications of ART. This section is very important due to the serious nature of the infection, and the specialized approaches for the pediatric population.
