Adolescent medicine focuses on the unique physical, psychological, and social needs of individuals transitioning from childhood to adulthood. Puberty and sexual development are central to this period. Tanner stages are used to classify the physical changes of puberty, including breast development in females, pubic hair development in both sexes, and genital development in males. Menarche is the onset of menstruation in females, typically occurring around age 12-13 years, but with a wide range of normal variation. Spermarche is the first ejaculation of sperm in males, occurring during puberty. Gynecological exams are recommended for adolescents, particularly those who are sexually active or have gynecological concerns. Contraception counseling and provision are important aspects of adolescent healthcare. Various contraceptive methods are available, including hormonal methods (oral contraceptive pills, patches, injections, implants, vaginal rings), barrier methods (condoms), and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC, such as intrauterine devices and implants). Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a significant concern in adolescents. Screening for STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV, is recommended for sexually active adolescents. Treatment involves appropriate antibiotics or antiviral medications. Adolescent pregnancy can have significant medical, social, and economic consequences. Providing comprehensive prenatal care, counseling on options (parenting, adoption, abortion), and support services are crucial.

Mental health is a major concern during adolescence. Depression is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, and other symptoms that interfere with functioning. Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, are also common. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa (restriction of food intake leading to significantly low body weight) and bulimia nervosa (binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like vomiting or laxative use), are serious conditions that typically emerge during adolescence. Substance abuse, including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, can have significant negative consequences on health and development. Suicide risk assessment is crucial, as suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although often diagnosed in childhood, can persist into adolescence and adulthood, causing inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Treatment for mental health disorders may involve psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy), medications (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics), and other interventions.

Common adolescent health concerns include acne, a common skin condition affecting many teenagers, which can be treated with topical or oral medications. Sports injuries are also frequent, requiring appropriate management and prevention strategies. Scoliosis, a lateral curvature of the spine, may be detected during adolescence and may require bracing or, in severe cases, surgery. Headaches, including migraines and tension headaches, are common in adolescents. The approach to adolescent health is important. Developing an approach that encourages open communication and trust is essential.
