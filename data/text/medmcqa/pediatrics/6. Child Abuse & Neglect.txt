Child abuse and neglect are significant public health problems with serious consequences for children's physical and mental health. Recognition and reporting are crucial responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Physical abuse involves inflicting physical injury on a child, such as hitting, shaking, burning, or poisoning. Suspicious injuries include bruises in unusual locations (e.g., torso, ears, neck), patterned injuries (e.g., from a belt or hand), fractures in infants or young children, and burns with clear lines of demarcation. Sexual abuse involves any sexual contact between a child and an adult or older adolescent. This includes touching, fondling, intercourse, and exploitation (e.g., child pornography). Indicators of sexual abuse can be physical (e.g., genital injuries, sexually transmitted infections) or behavioral (e.g., sexualized behavior, withdrawal, anxiety). Neglect is the failure to provide for a child's basic needs, including physical neglect (failure to provide adequate food, shelter, clothing, or hygiene), emotional neglect (failure to provide emotional support and nurturing), medical neglect (failure to provide necessary medical or dental care), and educational neglect (failure to ensure the child attends school or receives appropriate education). Munchausen syndrome by proxy (also known as factitious disorder imposed on another) is a form of abuse in which a caregiver (usually the mother) fabricates or induces illness in a child, seeking unnecessary medical attention.

Mandatory reporting laws require certain professionals (including healthcare providers) to report suspected child abuse or neglect to child protective services (CPS) or law enforcement. History taking is crucial in evaluating suspected abuse. It should be conducted in a private, child-friendly environment, using age-appropriate language. The child's statements should be carefully documented. The caregiver's explanation of the injury or illness should be assessed for consistency with the child's developmental stage and the physical findings. Physical examination should be thorough and well-documented, including detailed descriptions of any injuries, photographs if possible, and appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., skeletal survey for suspected physical abuse, STI testing for suspected sexual abuse). Documentation should be objective, factual, and include the child's statements, the caregiver's explanation, physical examination findings, and any laboratory results. Reporting to child protective services (CPS) is a legal obligation when there is reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect. The report should include identifying information about the child and family, the nature of the suspected abuse or neglect, and any supporting evidence. Healthcare providers should be familiar with the reporting procedures in their jurisdiction. After reporting, healthcare providers may need to collaborate with CPS and law enforcement in the investigation and management of the case. The focus should always be to provide the best medical care while protecting the child.
