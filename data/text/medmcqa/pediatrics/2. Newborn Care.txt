Neonatal resuscitation and stabilization are critical in the immediate care of the newborn. The Apgar score, assessed at 1 and 5 minutes after birth, provides a rapid evaluation of the newborn's condition, evaluating heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. A score of 7-10 is considered normal, 4-6 indicates moderate depression, and 0-3 indicates severe depression requiring immediate resuscitation. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines provide a standardized approach to neonatal resuscitation, emphasizing a stepwise approach: initial steps (drying, warming, stimulating, clearing the airway), followed by positive pressure ventilation (PPV) if needed, chest compressions if the heart rate remains low despite PPV, and administration of epinephrine if necessary. Thermoregulation is crucial in newborns, as they are prone to hypothermia. Maintaining a neutral thermal environment (skin temperature 36.5-37.5Â°C) is essential. Respiratory support may be required, ranging from supplemental oxygen to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of respiratory distress. Cardiovascular support may involve fluid resuscitation and, in rare cases, vasopressors. Management of hypoglycemia is important, as newborns have limited glucose stores. Early feeding (breastfeeding or formula feeding) is encouraged, and intravenous glucose may be necessary if hypoglycemia persists. Management of hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) is common. Physiologic jaundice is usually benign, but high levels of unconjugated bilirubin can lead to kernicterus (brain damage). Phototherapy is the primary treatment, and exchange transfusion may be necessary in severe cases.

Common neonatal problems require prompt recognition and management. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), primarily affecting premature infants, is caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, leading to alveolar collapse and respiratory failure. Treatment includes surfactant replacement therapy and respiratory support (CPAP or mechanical ventilation). Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a milder respiratory condition caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. It typically resolves within 24-72 hours with supportive care. Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) occurs when a newborn inhales meconium (the first stool) before or during delivery, leading to airway obstruction and respiratory distress. Management involves suctioning of the airway and respiratory support. Neonatal sepsis is a serious infection in the bloodstream, often caused by bacteria acquired during labor and delivery or from the environment. Early-onset sepsis (within the first 72 hours of life) is often caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Late-onset sepsis (after 72 hours) can be caused by various organisms. Symptoms are often non-specific (e.g., lethargy, poor feeding, temperature instability). Treatment involves antibiotics and supportive care. Hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) is common, as mentioned above. Hypoglycemia can occur due to inadequate glucose production or increased glucose utilization. Congenital anomalies (birth defects) can affect any organ system, and their management depends on the specific anomaly. Birth injuries can occur during labor and delivery, ranging from minor bruising to more serious injuries like fractures or nerve damage.

Prematurity (birth before 37 weeks of gestation) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Gestational age assessment is important to determine the degree of prematurity and anticipate potential complications. The Ballard score is a commonly used tool. Complications of prematurity are numerous. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), as previously described, is a major concern. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is bleeding into the ventricles of the brain, more common in very premature infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious intestinal condition characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the bowel. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding eye disorder affecting premature infants, caused by abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that can develop in premature infants who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Long-term outcomes of prematurity can include neurodevelopmental disabilities, chronic lung disease, and visual impairment. Management of prematurity involves a multidisciplinary approach, including respiratory support, nutritional support (often with parenteral nutrition initially, then transitioning to enteral feeding), temperature control, and careful monitoring for complications. Developmental follow-up is essential to identify and address any long-term sequelae.
