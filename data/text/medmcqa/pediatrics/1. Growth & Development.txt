Normal growth and development are fundamental aspects of pediatrics, encompassing physical, cognitive, and psychosocial changes from birth through adolescence. Growth charts are essential tools for assessing physical growth, plotting height, weight, and head circumference against age- and sex-specific percentiles. Deviations from expected growth patterns (e.g., failure to thrive, crossing percentiles) warrant investigation. Developmental milestones represent the acquisition of skills and abilities in various domains: gross motor (e.g., sitting, walking, running), fine motor (e.g., grasping, pincer grasp, drawing), language (e.g., babbling, first words, sentences), and social-emotional (e.g., social smile, stranger anxiety, cooperative play). Delays in achieving milestones may indicate developmental disorders. Pubertal development is the process of physical maturation leading to reproductive capability, characterized by hormonal changes and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Tanner stages describe the progression of pubertal changes in both males and females. Precocious puberty is the onset of puberty at an earlier than expected age, while delayed puberty is the absence or incomplete development of puberty by an expected age. Cognitive development refers to the development of thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities. Piaget's stages of cognitive development describe a sequence of stages: sensorimotor (birth to 2 years, learning through senses and actions), preoperational (2 to 7 years, symbolic thinking, egocentrism), concrete operational (7 to 11 years, logical thinking about concrete events), and formal operational (11 years and older, abstract thinking). Psychosocial development refers to the development of personality, social skills, and emotional regulation. Erikson's stages of psychosocial development describe a series of psychosocial crises that individuals face throughout life, each with a positive and negative outcome. For example, infancy (trust vs. mistrust), toddlerhood (autonomy vs. shame and doubt), preschool (initiative vs. guilt), school age (industry vs. inferiority), and adolescence (identity vs. role confusion).

Nutrition in pediatrics is crucial for optimal growth and development. Breastfeeding is the recommended method of infant feeding, providing numerous benefits for both the infant (e.g., reduced risk of infections, allergies, obesity) and the mother (e.g., faster postpartum recovery, reduced risk of breast cancer). Formula feeding provides an alternative when breastfeeding is not possible or chosen. Different types of formula are available, including cow's milk-based, soy-based, and specialized formulas. Introduction of solid foods typically begins around 6 months of age, progressing from pureed foods to more textured foods. Nutritional requirements vary with age. Infants have high energy and nutrient needs to support rapid growth. Children and adolescents require adequate intake of calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals for continued growth and development. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can have significant consequences. Iron deficiency anemia is common in infants and young children, leading to fatigue, developmental delays, and impaired immune function. Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets (softening and weakening of bones). Obesity is a growing concern in pediatrics, increasing the risk of various health problems, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, typically emerge during adolescence and can have serious physical and psychological consequences.

Genetics plays a significant role in many pediatric conditions. Chromosomal disorders result from abnormalities in chromosome number or structure. Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal disorder, characterized by intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, and an increased risk of certain medical conditions. Single-gene disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene, following Mendelian inheritance patterns (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked). Cystic fibrosis (an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the lungs and digestive system) and sickle cell anemia (an autosomal recessive disorder affecting red blood cells) are examples. Multifactorial inheritance involves the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors, contributing to conditions like neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida) and cleft lip/palate. Teratogens are substances that can cause birth defects, including certain medications (e.g., thalidomide), alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome), and infections (e.g., rubella). Genetic counseling provides information and support to individuals and families at risk for or affected by genetic disorders. Newborn screening is a public health program that screens newborns for certain genetic and metabolic disorders, allowing for early diagnosis and treatment. Phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that can lead to intellectual disability if untreated, is a common example of a condition screened for in newborns. These genetic considerations are important for any comprehensive Pediatrics exam.
