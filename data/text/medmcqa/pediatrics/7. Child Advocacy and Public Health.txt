Injury prevention is a critical aspect of child advocacy and public health, as injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Safe sleep practices are essential for infants to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This includes placing infants on their backs to sleep, in a crib with a firm mattress and no loose bedding, and avoiding co-sleeping. Car seat safety involves using age- and size-appropriate car seats and ensuring they are properly installed. Rear-facing car seats are recommended for infants and young children, transitioning to forward-facing car seats, booster seats, and then seat belts as the child grows. Home safety includes measures to prevent falls, burns, poisonings, and other injuries. This includes installing safety gates, window guards, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors, keeping medications and cleaning products out of reach of children, and setting the water heater temperature to 120°F (49°C) or lower. Poison prevention involves storing potentially poisonous substances (medications, cleaning products, chemicals) in locked cabinets and out of reach of children. The Poison Control Center phone number should be readily available. Water safety includes constant supervision of children around water (bathtubs, pools, lakes, oceans), teaching children to swim, and using life jackets. Fire safety includes having a fire escape plan, practicing fire drills, and teaching children about fire safety. Sports safety involves using appropriate protective gear (helmets, pads), ensuring proper supervision, and teaching children about safe sports practices. Injury prevention strategies often involve a combination of education, legislation (e.g., car seat laws, pool fencing laws), and community programs.

Public health issues in pediatrics encompass a range of concerns that affect the health and well-being of children at a population level. Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a threat, despite the availability of effective vaccines. Maintaining high vaccination rates is crucial to prevent outbreaks of diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and polio. Childhood obesity is a major public health problem, increasing the risk of various health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Interventions to address childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits, increasing physical activity, and addressing social and environmental factors that contribute to obesity. Lead poisoning, primarily from exposure to lead-based paint in older homes, can cause developmental delays, learning disabilities, and other health problems. Screening for lead poisoning is recommended for children at risk. Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects many children, leading to wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Management of asthma involves identifying and avoiding triggers, using medications (inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators), and developing an asthma action plan. Access to healthcare is a critical issue, as many children lack health insurance or face barriers to accessing care. Ensuring that all children have access to affordable, quality healthcare is essential for their health and well-being. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach, including screening programs (e.g., lead screening, developmental screening), community outreach (e.g., nutrition education programs, injury prevention programs), and health policy initiatives (e.g., legislation to promote healthy school environments, policies to improve access to healthcare).
