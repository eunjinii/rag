Pediatric cardiology addresses heart conditions in children. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are structural abnormalities of the heart present at birth. Acyanotic CHDs (left-to-right shunts) include ventricular septal defect (VSD, a hole in the ventricular septum), atrial septal defect (ASD, a hole in the atrial septum), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, a persistent connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery). Cyanotic CHDs (right-to-left shunts) include Tetralogy of Fallot (combination of VSD, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy), transposition of the great arteries (aorta arises from the right ventricle and pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle), and tricuspid atresia (absence of the tricuspid valve). Acquired heart diseases include rheumatic fever (an inflammatory condition triggered by Streptococcus pyogenes infection, potentially affecting the heart valves) and Kawasaki disease (an acute vasculitis that can cause coronary artery aneurysms). Heart murmurs are sounds produced by turbulent blood flow, which can be innocent (normal) or pathologic (due to structural heart disease). Cardiac arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms. Hypertension (high blood pressure) in children can be primary (essential) or secondary (due to an underlying condition). Diagnosis of cardiac conditions often involves echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart), electrocardiography (ECG), and sometimes cardiac catheterization. Treatment depends on the specific condition, ranging from medical management (e.g., medications for heart failure) to surgical repair.

Pediatric respiratory conditions are common and diverse. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include the common cold (viral infection of the nose and throat), pharyngitis (sore throat, can be viral or bacterial, e.g., strep throat), otitis media (middle ear infection, often bacterial), and sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses). Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) include bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways, usually caused by RSV in infants), pneumonia (infection of the lung parenchyma, can be viral or bacterial), and asthma (a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and bronchospasm). Asthma management involves inhaled corticosteroids (to reduce inflammation), bronchodilators (to relax airway muscles), and other medications. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems, primarily the lungs and digestive system. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to abnormal chloride transport and thick, sticky mucus production. CF management involves airway clearance techniques, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and nutritional support. Foreign body aspiration can occur when a foreign object is inhaled into the airway, causing obstruction and potentially respiratory distress.

Pediatric gastroenterology addresses disorders of the digestive system. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the backflow of stomach contents into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment involves lifestyle modifications and medications (H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors). Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the pyloric sphincter (the opening between the stomach and the small intestine), causing projectile vomiting in infants. Treatment is surgical (pyloromyotomy). Intussusception is the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another, causing bowel obstruction. It typically presents with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and "currant jelly" stools. Treatment is often with air or contrast enema, and sometimes surgery. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten ingestion, leading to damage to the small intestine. Treatment involves a strict gluten-free diet. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Constipation is a common problem in children, often due to dietary factors or behavioral issues. Diarrhea can be caused by infections (viral, bacterial, parasitic), food intolerances, or other conditions. Malnutrition can result from inadequate intake, malabsorption, or increased nutrient requirements.

Pediatric nephrology deals with kidney disorders. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, especially in girls. Symptoms include dysuria, frequency, urgency, and sometimes fever. Treatment involves antibiotics. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys, increasing the risk of UTIs and kidney damage. Glomerulonephritis is inflammation of the glomeruli (filtering units of the kidney), often caused by an immune response following an infection (e.g., post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden decline in kidney function. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a gradual loss of kidney function over time. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury, often caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection.

Pediatric neurology addresses disorders of the nervous system. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Febrile seizures are seizures triggered by fever in young children. Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Treatment involves antiepileptic drugs. Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), which can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, often caused by viruses. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of non-progressive motor disorders caused by brain damage during development. Headaches are common in children, and can be primary (e.g., migraine, tension headache) or secondary (due to an underlying condition). Developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affect brain development and function. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result from falls, motor vehicle accidents, or other trauma.

Pediatric hematology/oncology deals with blood disorders and cancers. Anemia is a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type, caused by inadequate iron intake or absorption. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene, leading to abnormal hemoglobin and sickle-shaped red blood cells. Thalassemia is an inherited disorder characterized by reduced synthesis of alpha or beta globin chains. Bleeding disorders result from defects in blood clotting. Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). von Willebrand disease is a common inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor. Leukemias are cancers of the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in children. Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system. Solid tumors in children include neuroblastoma (a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system), Wilms tumor (a kidney tumor), and retinoblastoma (a tumor of the retina). Treatment of childhood cancers often involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and bone marrow transplantation.

Pediatric endocrinology addresses hormone disorders. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia. Type 1 DM is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Treatment of type 1 DM involves insulin therapy. Hypothyroidism is a deficiency of thyroid hormone. Congenital hypothyroidism can cause developmental delays if untreated. Treatment involves thyroid hormone replacement. Hyperthyroidism is an excess of thyroid hormone. Growth hormone deficiency can cause short stature. Treatment involves growth hormone therapy. Precocious puberty is the early onset of puberty. Delayed puberty is the late or absent onset of puberty. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies in cortisol synthesis, leading to androgen excess.

Pediatric rheumatology addresses autoimmune and inflammatory disorders affecting the joints, muscles, and connective tissues. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children, characterized by joint inflammation and pain. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and a characteristic skin rash. Vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels.

Pediatric dermatology concerns skin disorders in children. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by itchy, dry, and inflamed skin. Acne is a common skin condition affecting adolescents, characterized by pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection, often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, characterized by honey-colored crusts. Tinea infections (ringworm) are fungal skin infections. Viral exanthems are skin rashes caused by viral infections, such as measles, chickenpox, and roseola. Scabies is a contagious skin infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. Lice are parasitic insects that infest the hair and scalp. This section covered the majority of organ system based concerns within the pediatric population.
