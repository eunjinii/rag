Clinical/Applied Anatomy builds upon the foundational knowledge. Surgical Anatomy emphasizes the anatomical relationships relevant to surgical procedures. Understanding the location of major vessels, nerves, and organs is crucial for avoiding iatrogenic injury. Anatomical landmarks are used to guide incisions and dissections. Variations in anatomy, such as variations in branching patterns of vessels, must be considered.

Vestigial structures (structures that have lost their original function) are identified. Anatomical data is used to construct phylogenetic trees, illustrating evolutionary relationships between species.

Functional Anatomy studies Biomechanics, specifically: the mechanical properties of connective tissues like ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. Analyzing these structures' responses to tensile and compressive forces are critical. Analyzing the stress and strain curves and understanding concepts like Young's modulus is vital. Bone's mechanical properties, including cortical and trabecular bone's responses to load, are vital. Wolff's law (bone remodeling in response to mechanical stress) should be understood. Movement Analysis requires knowing and describing movements on different planes (sagittal, frontal, transverse). Skeletal Muscle Contraction requires knowing the neuromuscular junction events, and the sliding filament mechanism during different contraction types (isometric, isotonic, eccentric).
