Surgical Anatomy necessitates a profound understanding of anatomical relationships, enabling surgeons to perform procedures safely and effectively. This involves a precise knowledge of the location of major blood vessels, nerves, and organs, particularly in relation to surgical incisions and approaches. For instance, a surgeon performing a thyroidectomy must be intimately familiar with the location of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which innervate the vocal cords, to avoid iatrogenic injury. Similarly, knowledge of the course of the facial nerve is crucial during parotid gland surgery. Anatomical landmarks, palpable or visible surface features, guide surgeons in locating deeper structures. For example, the iliac crest is a palpable landmark used to determine the location of the L4 vertebra for lumbar puncture. Understanding variations in anatomy is paramount. Variations in the branching patterns of blood vessels, such as the cystic artery during cholecystectomy, are common and must be anticipated. Surgeons utilize different approaches to access specific organs or regions, each with its own anatomical considerations. For example, a median sternotomy provides access to the heart and great vessels, while a laparotomy provides access to the abdominal cavity. Minimizing iatrogenic injury (injury caused by medical treatment) is a core principle of surgical anatomy. Careful dissection, meticulous hemostasis (control of bleeding), and respect for anatomical planes are essential. The concept of fascial planes, layers of connective tissue that separate different compartments, is important for understanding the spread of infection and for surgical dissection.

Radiological Anatomy focuses on the interpretation of medical images to visualize and diagnose anatomical structures and pathological conditions. X-rays (radiographs) are based on the differential absorption of X-rays by different tissues. Bone, being dense, appears white (radiopaque), while air-filled structures, such as the lungs, appear black (radiolucent). X-rays are commonly used to visualize bones, detect fractures, and assess lung fields. Computed Tomography (CT) scans use X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the body. CT scans provide greater detail than plain X-rays and can differentiate between soft tissues more effectively. Contrast agents, such as iodine-based compounds, can be used to enhance the visualization of blood vessels and organs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create images. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, making it particularly useful for visualizing the brain, spinal cord, and musculoskeletal structures. Different MRI sequences (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted) highlight different tissue characteristics. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create images. Ultrasound is a real-time imaging modality, allowing visualization of moving structures, such as the heart and blood flow. Ultrasound is particularly useful for imaging soft tissues, such as the liver, kidneys, and fetus during pregnancy. Interpretation of radiological images requires a thorough knowledge of normal anatomy. Anatomical structures are identified based on their shape, size, location, and density (on X-rays and CT scans) or signal intensity (on MRI). Pathological findings, such as tumors, fractures, and inflammation, are recognized by their deviation from normal anatomy. Radiological imaging is used to guide procedures, such as biopsies, catheter placements, and fluid drainage. Interventional radiologists use imaging guidance to perform minimally invasive procedures. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) are used to store, retrieve, and display medical images.

Surface Anatomy involves the identification and palpation of anatomical structures through the skin. This is a fundamental skill for physical examination and clinical procedures. Bony landmarks, such as the spinous processes of the vertebrae, the acromion of the scapula, and the medial and lateral malleoli of the ankle, are readily palpable and serve as reference points. Muscles and tendons can be palpated, particularly when they are contracted. For example, the biceps brachii tendon can be palpated in the antecubital fossa. Major blood vessels, such as the radial artery at the wrist and the carotid artery in the neck, can be palpated to assess pulse. Surface anatomy is used to locate underlying structures. For example, the location of the heart valves can be approximated based on surface landmarks. Knowledge of surface anatomy is crucial for performing physical examinations, administering injections, inserting intravenous lines, and taking pulses. Dermatomes, areas of skin innervated by a single spinal nerve, are important for assessing sensory function. Myotomes, groups of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve, are important for assessing motor function. The ability to correlate surface findings with underlying anatomical structures is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment. For example, tenderness to palpation over McBurney's point (a point in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen) is suggestive of appendicitis. Understanding referred pain, pain felt in a location different from its source, is also important. For instance, pain from the diaphragm can be referred to the shoulder. Clinical applications of surface anatomy are pervasive in healthcare, impacting both diagnostic and interventional procedures. The ability to accurately locate and interpret surface anatomical features is a core competency for all healthcare professionals. Clinical/Applied Neuroanatomy, is also an important sub-specialty.
