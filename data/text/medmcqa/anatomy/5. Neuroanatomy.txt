The Central Nervous System (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord, the core of information processing and control. The brain, encased within the skull, is organized into distinct regions, each with specialized functions. The cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, consists of two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of gray matter, is highly convoluted, with gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves) increasing its surface area. The cortex is divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. The frontal lobe is involved in higher-level cognitive functions, including planning, decision-making, working memory, and motor control (primary motor cortex located in the precentral gyrus). Broca's area, typically located in the left frontal lobe, is crucial for speech production. The parietal lobe processes sensory information, including touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception (body position) (primary somatosensory cortex located in the postcentral gyrus). The temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing, memory (hippocampus), and language comprehension (Wernicke's area, typically in the left temporal lobe). The occipital lobe is dedicated to visual processing. Deep within the cerebrum lie subcortical structures. The basal ganglia, a group of nuclei including the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra, play a crucial role in motor control, particularly in the initiation and selection of movements. The thalamus, a relay center for sensory and motor signals, receives input from various sensory pathways and projects to the cortex. The hypothalamus, located below the thalamus, regulates autonomic functions, endocrine control (via the pituitary gland), and homeostasis (body temperature, hunger, thirst). The brainstem, connecting the cerebrum to the spinal cord, consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The midbrain contains nuclei involved in motor control (red nucleus, substantia nigra), eye movements, and auditory and visual reflexes. The pons contains nuclei involved in breathing, sleep, and relaying information to the cerebellum. The medulla oblongata contains vital centers controlling heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. Cranial nerve nuclei (except for I and II) are located within the brainstem. The cerebellum, located posterior to the brainstem, plays a critical role in motor coordination, balance, and motor learning. It receives input from the motor cortex, sensory systems, and the brainstem, and it projects back to the motor cortex via the thalamus. The spinal cord, a long, cylindrical structure extending from the brainstem, is housed within the vertebral column. It is divided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions. The spinal cord contains gray matter (cell bodies) and white matter (axons). The gray matter is organized into a butterfly-shaped central region, with dorsal horns (receiving sensory input), ventral horns (containing motor neuron cell bodies), and lateral horns (containing autonomic neurons in the thoracic and upper lumbar regions). The white matter is organized into ascending tracts (carrying sensory information to the brain) and descending tracts (carrying motor commands from the brain). Key ascending tracts include the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (carrying fine touch, vibration, and proprioception) and the spinothalamic tract (carrying pain and temperature). Key descending tracts include the corticospinal tract (controlling voluntary movement) and the rubrospinal tract (involved in motor control). Spinal nerves, carrying both sensory and motor fibers, exit the spinal cord through intervertebral foramina. The meninges, three layers of protective membranes, surround the brain and spinal cord. The dura mater, the outermost layer, is tough and fibrous. The arachnoid mater, the middle layer, is delicate and web-like. The pia mater, the innermost layer, is closely adherent to the brain and spinal cord. The subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid and pia mater, contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF, produced by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain, cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord, provides nutrients, and removes waste products. The ventricles, a system of interconnected cavities within the brain, are filled with CSF. There are two lateral ventricles (one in each cerebral hemisphere), a third ventricle (in the diencephalon), and a fourth ventricle (in the brainstem). The cerebral aqueduct connects the third and fourth ventricles. CSF circulates through the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space, where it is eventually reabsorbed into the venous system. The blood supply to the brain is crucial for its function. The internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries supply the brain. The internal carotid arteries give rise to the anterior cerebral arteries (supplying the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes) and the middle cerebral arteries (supplying the lateral aspects of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes). The vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, which gives rise to the posterior cerebral arteries (supplying the occipital lobe and parts of the temporal lobe). The Circle of Willis, an anastomosis of arteries at the base of the brain, provides collateral circulation. Venous drainage of the brain occurs through the dural venous sinuses, which drain into the internal jugular veins. The blood-brain barrier, formed by tight junctions between endothelial cells in brain capillaries, restricts the passage of substances from the blood into the brain, protecting it from toxins and pathogens. The spinal cord receives its blood supply from the anterior spinal artery (supplying the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord) and the posterior spinal arteries (supplying the posterior one-third).

The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) includes all nervous tissue outside the brain and spinal cord. Cranial nerves, twelve pairs of nerves, emerge from the brainstem (except for I and II, which emerge from the forebrain). Cranial Nerve I (Olfactory): Sensory, smell. Cranial Nerve II (Optic): Sensory, vision. Cranial Nerve III (Oculomotor): Motor, eye movements (most extraocular muscles), pupillary constriction, and accommodation. Cranial Nerve IV (Trochlear): Motor, eye movement (superior oblique muscle). Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal): Sensory and motor, sensation from the face, muscles of mastication. Cranial Nerve VI (Abducens): Motor, eye movement (lateral rectus muscle). Cranial Nerve VII (Facial): Sensory and motor, taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, muscles of facial expression, lacrimation, and salivation. Cranial Nerve VIII (Vestibulocochlear): Sensory, hearing and balance. Cranial Nerve IX (Glossopharyngeal): Sensory and motor, taste from the posterior one-third of the tongue, swallowing, salivation. Cranial Nerve X (Vagus): Sensory and motor, parasympathetic innervation to thoracic and abdominal organs, swallowing, speech. Cranial Nerve XI (Accessory): Motor, head and shoulder movement (sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles). Cranial Nerve XII (Hypoglossal): Motor, tongue movement. Spinal nerves, 31 pairs of nerves, emerge from the spinal cord. Each spinal nerve is formed by the union of a dorsal root (carrying sensory fibers) and a ventral root (carrying motor fibers). Spinal nerves exit the vertebral column through intervertebral foramina. After exiting, spinal nerves divide into dorsal rami (innervating the skin and muscles of the back) and ventral rami (innervating the skin and muscles of the anterior and lateral trunk and the limbs). Ventral rami of spinal nerves form plexuses (networks of nerves) in the cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral regions. The cervical plexus (C1-C4) innervates the muscles and skin of the neck and the diaphragm (phrenic nerve). The brachial plexus (C5-T1) innervates the muscles and skin of the upper limb. Key nerves arising from the brachial plexus include the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and radial nerve. The lumbar plexus (L1-L4) innervates the muscles and skin of the anterior and medial thigh. Key nerves include the femoral nerve and obturator nerve. The sacral plexus (L4-S4) innervates the muscles and skin of the posterior thigh, leg, and foot. The major nerve arising from the sacral plexus is the sciatic nerve. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), a part of the PNS, controls involuntary functions, such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration. The ANS has two divisions: sympathetic and parasympathetic. The sympathetic division, also known as the "fight-or-flight" system, prepares the body for action. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord (T1-L2). Their axons exit the spinal cord via ventral roots and synapse in sympathetic ganglia, which are located along the vertebral column (sympathetic chain ganglia) or in front of the aorta (prevertebral ganglia). Postganglionic sympathetic neurons project to target organs, releasing norepinephrine as their neurotransmitter. The parasympathetic division, also known as the "rest-and-digest" system, promotes relaxation and energy conservation. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in the brainstem (cranial nerve nuclei III, VII, IX, X) and the sacral spinal cord (S2-S4). Their axons travel with cranial nerves or pelvic splanchnic nerves to synapse in ganglia located near or within target organs. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons release acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter. The effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation on target organs are often opposite. For example, sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate, while parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation dilates pupils, while parasympathetic stimulation constricts pupils. Understanding the specific effects of each division on various organs is essential. The enteric nervous system, a complex network of neurons within the walls of the digestive tract, controls gastrointestinal motility and secretion. It can function independently of the CNS, but it is also modulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.
