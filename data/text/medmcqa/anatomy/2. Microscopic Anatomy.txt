Histology, the study of tissues, centers around four fundamental tissue types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue. Epithelial tissue is characterized by tightly packed cells with minimal extracellular matrix, primarily serving as coverings and linings of body surfaces and forming glands. Epithelia are classified based on the shape of the cells (squamous, cuboidal, columnar) and the number of cell layers (simple, stratified, pseudostratified). Specialized epithelial types, such as transitional epithelium (lining the urinary bladder) and pseudostratified columnar epithelium with cilia (lining the respiratory tract), possess unique structural adaptations for their specific functions. Cell junctions, including tight junctions (preventing paracellular passage), adherens junctions (providing mechanical attachment), desmosomes (strong cell-to-cell adhesion), and gap junctions (allowing intercellular communication), play critical roles in maintaining epithelial integrity and function. Glands, derived from epithelial cells, are classified as exocrine (secreting onto a surface via ducts) or endocrine (secreting hormones into the bloodstream). Exocrine glands are further classified based on their mode of secretion (merocrine, apocrine, holocrine) and duct structure (simple, compound). Connective tissue, in contrast to epithelium, is characterized by abundant extracellular matrix with relatively fewer cells. Connective tissue provides support, connection, and protection for other tissues and organs. The extracellular matrix consists of fibers (collagen, elastic, reticular) and ground substance (a gel-like material containing proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and glycoproteins). Connective tissue is classified into several types, including connective tissue proper (loose, dense regular, dense irregular, elastic, reticular, adipose), cartilage (hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage), bone (compact, spongy), and blood. Loose connective tissue has loosely arranged fibers and abundant ground substance, providing support and cushioning. Dense connective tissue, with densely packed fibers, provides strength and resistance to tension. Cartilage, with a firm, gel-like matrix, provides support and flexibility. Bone, with a mineralized matrix, provides rigid support and protection. Blood, a fluid connective tissue, transports oxygen, nutrients, and waste products. Each connective tissue type contains specialized cells responsible for producing and maintaining the extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts are the most common cell type in connective tissue proper, synthesizing collagen, elastin, and ground substance. Chondrocytes reside in cartilage, maintaining the cartilaginous matrix. Osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts are responsible for bone formation, maintenance, and remodeling. Muscle tissue is specialized for contraction, enabling movement. There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle is characterized by long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells with striations (visible banding patterns). Skeletal muscle contraction is voluntary and under the control of the somatic nervous system. The sarcomere, the basic functional unit of skeletal muscle, contains overlapping actin and myosin filaments that slide past each other during contraction, shortening the muscle fiber. Smooth muscle, found in the walls of internal organs and blood vessels, consists of spindle-shaped cells with a single nucleus and no striations. Smooth muscle contraction is involuntary and regulated by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, and local factors. Cardiac muscle, found only in the heart, is characterized by branched cells with a single nucleus, striations, and intercalated discs (specialized junctions connecting adjacent cells). Cardiac muscle contraction is involuntary and intrinsically regulated, with modulation by the autonomic nervous system. Nervous tissue is specialized for communication, transmitting electrical and chemical signals throughout the body. Nervous tissue consists of two main cell types: neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the functional units of the nervous system, responsible for receiving, processing, and transmitting information. Neurons have a cell body (soma), dendrites (receiving signals), and an axon (transmitting signals). Synapses are specialized junctions between neurons, where neurotransmitters are released to transmit signals from one neuron to another. Glial cells provide support, protection, and nourishment for neurons. There are several types of glial cells, including astrocytes (providing structural support and regulating the chemical environment), oligodendrocytes (forming myelin sheaths in the CNS), Schwann cells (forming myelin sheaths in the PNS), microglia (acting as immune cells), and ependymal cells (lining the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord). Myelin, a fatty sheath surrounding axons, increases the speed of nerve impulse conduction. Organ-Specific Histology delves into the microscopic organization of individual organs, correlating structure with function. For example, the liver is organized into lobules, with hepatocytes arranged in plates radiating from a central vein. Sinusoids, specialized capillaries, are located between the hepatocyte plates, allowing blood to flow past the hepatocytes. Bile canaliculi, small channels between hepatocytes, collect bile produced by the hepatocytes. The kidney is composed of nephrons, the functional units of the kidney. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus (a tuft of capillaries where filtration occurs), a proximal convoluted tubule (reabsorbing water, ions, and nutrients), a loop of Henle (establishing a concentration gradient in the medulla), a distal convoluted tubule (regulating ion and water balance), and a collecting duct (collecting urine from multiple nephrons). The lung is characterized by alveoli, tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs. Alveoli are lined by a thin epithelium (type I pneumocytes) and are surrounded by capillaries. Type II pneumocytes secrete surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse. The intestine is characterized by villi, finger-like projections of the mucosa that increase the surface area for absorption. Each villus contains a core of connective tissue with blood vessels and a lacteal (a lymphatic vessel). The epithelium lining the villi is composed of absorptive cells (enterocytes) with microvilli (further increasing surface area) and goblet cells (secreting mucus). The microscopic structure of each organ is intricately related to its specific functions.

Cytology, the study of cells, examines the internal organization and functions of cellular components. The plasma membrane, a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, forms the boundary of the cell, regulating the passage of substances into and out of the cell. The cytoplasm, the region between the plasma membrane and the nucleus, contains the organelles and the cytosol (the fluid portion of the cytoplasm). The nucleus, the control center of the cell, contains the cell's DNA, organized into chromosomes. The nucleolus, a region within the nucleus, is the site of ribosome synthesis. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency, through cellular respiration. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis, translating mRNA into polypeptide chains. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of interconnected membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis and transport. The rough ER, studded with ribosomes, is involved in protein synthesis and processing. The smooth ER, lacking ribosomes, is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, and calcium storage. The Golgi apparatus is a stack of flattened membrane-bound sacs that further processes, modifies, and packages proteins and lipids. Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles containing enzymes that break down cellular waste products, damaged organelles, and ingested materials. Peroxisomes are membrane-bound organelles containing enzymes involved in various metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of fatty acids and the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide. The cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments, provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and enables cell movement and intracellular transport. The cytoskeleton consists of three main types of filaments: microtubules (hollow tubes made of tubulin), microfilaments (thin filaments made of actin), and intermediate filaments (rope-like structures made of various proteins). The cell cycle, the sequence of events leading to cell growth and division, is tightly regulated. The cell cycle consists of interphase (G1, S, and G2 phases) and mitosis (M phase). During interphase, the cell grows, replicates its DNA (S phase), and prepares for division. Mitosis, the process of nuclear division, results in two identical daughter cells. Meiosis, a specialized type of cell division, occurs in germ cells (cells that give rise to gametes) and results in four haploid daughter cells (cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell). Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction. Cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, membrane transport, cellular respiration, and cell signaling, are complex and tightly regulated. Protein synthesis involves transcription (the synthesis of mRNA from a DNA template) and translation (the synthesis of a polypeptide chain from mRNA at the ribosome). Membrane transport mechanisms include passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and endocytosis/exocytosis. Cellular respiration involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, generating ATP from glucose. Cell signaling pathways involve the reception of extracellular signals, transduction of the signal across the plasma membrane, and intracellular responses. Cellular specializations reflect adaptations of cells for specific functions. Nerve cells (neurons) have long axons and dendrites for transmitting electrical signals. Muscle cells (myocytes) contain contractile proteins (actin and myosin) for generating force. Secretory cells have abundant rough ER and Golgi apparatus for synthesizing and secreting proteins. Absorptive cells have microvilli to increase surface area for absorption. The understanding of cellular structure and function is crucial, connecting with Histology.
