Antimicrobials are a broad class of drugs that inhibit or kill microorganisms, including antibiotics (targeting bacteria), antivirals (targeting viruses), antifungals (targeting fungi), and antiparasitics (targeting parasites). Antibiotics have diverse mechanisms of action. Beta-lactams (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems) inhibit cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin) inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Macrolides (e.g., erythromycin, azithromycin) inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) inhibit DNA replication by targeting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline) inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Sulfonamides (e.g., sulfamethoxazole) inhibit folic acid synthesis, a pathway essential for bacterial growth. The spectrum of activity refers to the range of microorganisms an antimicrobial is effective against. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are active against a wide range of bacteria, while narrow-spectrum antibiotics are active against a limited number of bacteria. Pharmacokinetics describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a drug. Pharmacodynamics describes the relationship between drug concentration and antimicrobial effect. Adverse effects of antimicrobials can range from mild (e.g., nausea, diarrhea) to severe (e.g., allergic reactions, organ toxicity). Drug interactions can occur when antimicrobials are used concurrently with other drugs. Principles of antimicrobial stewardship involve using antimicrobials judiciously to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the development of resistance. This includes selecting the appropriate drug, dose, and duration of therapy, and avoiding unnecessary antimicrobial use.

Antiviral drugs target specific steps in the viral replication cycle. Nucleoside analogs (e.g., acyclovir for herpesviruses, AZT for HIV) inhibit viral DNA or RNA polymerase. Protease inhibitors (e.g., for HIV) block the processing of viral proteins. Entry inhibitors (e.g., for HIV) prevent viral attachment or entry into host cells. Antifungal drugs target specific components or processes unique to fungi. Azoles (e.g., fluconazole, voriconazole) inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. Polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B) bind to ergosterol, creating pores and causing cell leakage. Echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin) inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan, another important component of the fungal cell wall. Antiparasitic drugs target specific metabolic pathways or structures unique to the parasite. Antimalarial drugs (e.g., chloroquine, artemisinin derivatives) target different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Metronidazole is used to treat infections caused by Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Albendazole and mebendazole are broad-spectrum antihelminthic drugs.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat. Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are diverse. Enzyme inactivation involves the production of enzymes that destroy or inactivate the antimicrobial (e.g., beta-lactamases that hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics). Target modification involves altering the target site of the antimicrobial, reducing its binding affinity (e.g., altered penicillin-binding proteins in MRSA, mutations in ribosomal RNA conferring resistance to macrolides). Efflux pumps actively pump the antimicrobial out of the cell, reducing its intracellular concentration. Reduced permeability involves altering the cell membrane or cell wall to prevent the antimicrobial from entering the cell. The spread of resistance genes often occurs through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms (transformation, transduction, conjugation), allowing bacteria to acquire resistance genes from other bacteria. Detection of resistance involves various methods. Disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) testing involves placing antibiotic-impregnated disks on an agar plate inoculated with the bacteria and measuring the zone of inhibition. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination involves determining the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibits bacterial growth. Molecular methods (e.g., PCR) can detect specific resistance genes. Strategies to combat resistance include antimicrobial stewardship programs (promoting judicious antimicrobial use), infection prevention and control measures (reducing the spread of resistant organisms), development of new antimicrobials and alternative therapies, and public awareness campaigns. The ongoing emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms necessitate a multifaceted approach to preserve the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials and develop new treatment options.
