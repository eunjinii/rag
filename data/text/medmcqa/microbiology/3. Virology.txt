Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, lacking the machinery for independent replication and metabolism. They consist of a nucleic acid genome (DNA or RNA, single-stranded or double-stranded, linear or circular) enclosed within a protein coat called a capsid. The capsid is composed of protein subunits called capsomeres, arranged in symmetrical structures (helical, icosahedral, or complex). Some viruses possess an outer lipid envelope, derived from the host cell membrane, containing viral glycoproteins that mediate attachment to host cells. Viral replication cycles vary but generally involve: attachment to specific host cell receptors; entry via endocytosis or membrane fusion; uncoating, releasing the viral genome; replication of the viral genome and synthesis of viral proteins using host cell machinery; assembly of new viral particles; and release by budding (enveloped viruses) or cell lysis. Viral classification is based on various criteria, most notably the Baltimore classification system, which groups viruses based on their genome type and replication strategy: Class I (dsDNA viruses), Class II (ssDNA viruses), Class III (dsRNA viruses), Class IV (+ssRNA viruses, directly serving as mRNA), Class V (-ssRNA viruses, requiring transcription to produce mRNA), Class VI (ssRNA-RT viruses, using reverse transcriptase to create DNA from RNA), and Class VII (dsDNA-RT viruses). Viral cultivation requires living cells. Cell culture is commonly used, involving growing host cells in vitro and infecting them with the virus. Embryonated chicken eggs can also be used for some viruses (e.g., influenza virus). Viral quantification methods include plaque assays, where dilutions of the virus are added to cell cultures, and the number of plaques (areas of cell lysis) is counted, providing a measure of infectious virus particles.

Mechanisms of viral pathogenesis involve complex interactions between the virus and the host. Cell tropism refers to the specific cell types or tissues that a virus can infect, determined by the presence of appropriate host cell receptors. Viruses can evade the host's immune system through various mechanisms, including antigenic variation (changing surface antigens to avoid antibody recognition), inhibition of interferon signaling (interfering with antiviral responses), and establishing latency (remaining dormant within host cells for extended periods). HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus (Class VI) that infects CD4+ T cells, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The virus uses its envelope glycoprotein gp120 to bind to CD4 and a co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the host cell. Reverse transcriptase converts the viral RNA genome into DNA, which integrates into the host cell's genome. Influenza viruses (Orthomyxoviruses, Class V) cause influenza (flu), characterized by respiratory symptoms. They possess hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins, crucial for attachment and release. Antigenic drift (minor mutations in HA and NA) and antigenic shift (reassortment of gene segments between different influenza strains) contribute to the virus's ability to evade immunity and cause epidemics and pandemics. Hepatitis viruses (various families and classes) cause liver inflammation. Hepatitis B virus (HBV, a hepadnavirus, Class VII) is a DNA virus transmitted through blood and body fluids, potentially causing chronic infection and liver cirrhosis or cancer. Hepatitis C virus (HCV, a flavivirus, Class IV) is an RNA virus with similar transmission routes and potential for chronic infection. Herpesviruses (Class I) are DNA viruses that establish latency. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes oral or genital herpes. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause infections in immunocompromised individuals. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with infectious mononucleosis and certain cancers. Human papillomavirus (HPV, a papillomavirus, Class I) is a DNA virus that infects epithelial cells. Certain HPV types are associated with cervical cancer and other cancers. Coronaviruses (Class IV) are RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, causing respiratory illness with varying severity. Antiviral therapies target various stages of the viral replication cycle. Nucleoside analogs inhibit viral DNA or RNA polymerase (e.g., acyclovir for herpesviruses, remdesivir for some RNA viruses). Protease inhibitors block viral protease enzymes necessary for protein processing (e.g., HIV protease inhibitors). Reverse transcriptase inhibitors target the reverse transcriptase enzyme of retroviruses (e.g., HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Entry inhibitors prevent viral entry into host cells (e.g., enfuvirtide for HIV). Neuraminidase inhibitors block the release of influenza virus from infected cells (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir). Understanding the mechanisms of these drugs is essential for understanding treatment options.
