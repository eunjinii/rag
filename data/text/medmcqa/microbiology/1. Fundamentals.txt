Microbial cell structure fundamentally distinguishes prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) from eukaryotes (fungi, parasites). Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles; their genetic material resides in a nucleoid region. Key structural components include the cell wall, which provides rigidity and shape. Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan layer, while Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent endotoxin. Acid-fast bacteria, like Mycobacterium, have a cell wall rich in mycolic acids, making them resistant to Gram staining. The cytoplasmic membrane, a phospholipid bilayer, controls the passage of substances into and out of the cell. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis; bacterial ribosomes (70S) differ from eukaryotic ribosomes (80S), making them a target for some antibiotics. Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can carry genes for antibiotic resistance or virulence factors. Endospores are highly resistant, dormant structures formed by some bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Clostridium) under unfavorable conditions, allowing survival in harsh environments. Capsules, composed of polysaccharides or proteins, surround some bacteria, providing protection from phagocytosis and contributing to virulence. Flagella are protein appendages responsible for motility, while pili (fimbriae) mediate attachment to host cells and surfaces. Bacterial shapes vary widely, including cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), spirilla (spiral), and others, often aiding in preliminary identification. Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms encased in a self-produced extracellular matrix, adhering to surfaces and exhibiting increased resistance to antimicrobials and host defenses, posing significant challenges in medical settings.

Microbial growth and metabolism encompass the processes by which microorganisms increase in number and utilize nutrients. The bacterial growth curve describes population growth in a closed system, featuring a lag phase (adaptation), a log (exponential) phase (rapid division), a stationary phase (growth rate equals death rate), and a death phase (decline in viable cells). Generation time, the time required for a population to double, varies among species and is influenced by environmental conditions. Microorganisms have diverse nutritional requirements, including sources of carbon (for organic molecules), nitrogen (for proteins and nucleic acids), and energy. Autotrophs obtain carbon from carbon dioxide, while heterotrophs obtain it from organic compounds. Phototrophs derive energy from light, while chemotrophs obtain it from chemical compounds. Metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), and the electron transport chain, generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency. Aerobic respiration utilizes oxygen as the final electron acceptor, yielding the most ATP. Anaerobic respiration uses other inorganic molecules as final electron acceptors, yielding less ATP. Fermentation is an anaerobic process that does not involve the electron transport chain, producing less ATP and characteristic end products (e.g., lactic acid, ethanol). Culture media provide the necessary nutrients for microbial growth in the laboratory. Defined media contain precise amounts of known chemicals, while complex media contain undefined components like yeast extract or peptone. Selective media inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms while allowing others to grow, facilitating isolation. Differential media allow distinguishing between different types of microorganisms based on their metabolic characteristics, often through color changes.

Microbial genetics governs the inheritance and expression of genetic information in microorganisms. Bacterial DNA replication is a semiconservative process, initiated at a specific origin of replication and proceeding bidirectionally. Transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template by RNA polymerase. Translation is the process of protein synthesis, where ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Gene regulation controls the expression of genes in response to environmental cues. Operons are clusters of genes transcribed together as a single mRNA, often involved in a related metabolic pathway. Repressors are proteins that bind to DNA and block transcription, while activators enhance transcription. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, which can be spontaneous or induced by mutagens. Horizontal gene transfer allows bacteria to acquire new genetic material from other bacteria, even of different species, contributing to genetic diversity and the spread of antibiotic resistance. Transformation involves the uptake of naked DNA from the environment. Transduction is the transfer of DNA via bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Conjugation is the transfer of DNA through direct cell-to-cell contact, often mediated by plasmids. Plasmids often carry genes for antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, or other advantageous traits. CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against bacteriophages and foreign DNA, involving recognition and cleavage of specific DNA sequences. These genetic mechanisms contribute to the remarkable adaptability and evolution of microorganisms. They explain how bacteria acquire genes that lead to drug resistance. They also impact the diagnostics and treatments of infections caused by bacterial pathogens.
