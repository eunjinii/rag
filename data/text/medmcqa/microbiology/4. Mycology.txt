Fungal cell structure, being eukaryotic, is more complex than that of bacteria. Fungal cells possess a nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and other membrane-bound organelles. A defining characteristic is their cell wall, composed primarily of chitin, a strong, flexible polysaccharide, differentiating them from plant cell walls (cellulose) and bacterial cell walls (peptidoglycan). Fungal morphology varies. Yeasts are unicellular fungi that reproduce by budding or fission. Molds are multicellular fungi composed of thread-like filaments called hyphae. Hyphae can be septate (with cross-walls dividing them into individual cells) or coenocytic (lacking cross-walls, forming a continuous multinucleated cytoplasm). A mass of hyphae is called a mycelium. Dimorphic fungi can exist in both yeast and mold forms, often depending on temperature or environmental conditions (yeast form at body temperature, mold form at room temperature). Fungal reproduction can be sexual or asexual. Asexual reproduction occurs through the formation of spores, such as conidia (formed on specialized structures called conidiophores) or sporangiospores (formed within a sac-like structure called a sporangium). Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two compatible nuclei, followed by meiosis, leading to the formation of sexual spores (e.g., ascospores, basidiospores, zygospores). Fungal classification is based on their sexual reproductive structures. Ascomycota (sac fungi) produce ascospores within an ascus. Basidiomycota (club fungi) produce basidiospores on a basidium. Zygomycota (conjugation fungi) form zygospores through the fusion of two hyphal tips. Deuteromycota (fungi imperfecti) was a former classification for fungi with no known sexual stage, but molecular methods have largely placed these fungi within other phyla.

Major fungal pathogens cause a range of diseases, from superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic infections. Candida species, particularly Candida albicans, are yeasts that are part of the normal human flora but can cause opportunistic infections (candidiasis), including oral thrush, vaginal yeast infections, and invasive candidiasis (in immunocompromised individuals). Aspergillus species, especially Aspergillus fumigatus, are molds that can cause aspergillosis, primarily affecting the lungs (pulmonary aspergillosis), particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying lung disease. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that causes cryptococcosis, primarily manifesting as meningitis, especially in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Dermatophytes are a group of fungi (including Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton) that cause superficial skin infections (tinea infections), commonly known as ringworm, athlete's foot, and jock itch. Mycoses (fungal infections) are classified based on the location and depth of infection. Superficial mycoses affect the outermost layers of skin and hair. Cutaneous mycoses involve the deeper layers of the epidermis, hair, and nails. Subcutaneous mycoses affect the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, and muscle. Systemic mycoses are deep infections that can involve multiple organs and are often life-threatening, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Antifungal therapies target specific components or processes unique to fungi. Azoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. Polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B) bind to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating pores and causing cell leakage. Echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin) inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan, another important component of the fungal cell wall. Allylamines (e.g., terbinafine) inhibit squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in the ergosterol synthesis pathway. Other antifungals have different mechanisms of action. Antifungal resistance is an increasing concern, particularly in Candida species. The choice of antifungal therapy depends on the specific fungal pathogen, the site and severity of infection, and the patient's immune status.
