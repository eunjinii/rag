Parasite life cycles are often complex, involving multiple stages and hosts. A direct life cycle involves only one host, where the parasite is transmitted directly from one infected host to another (e.g., through fecal-oral route). An indirect life cycle involves two or more hosts. The definitive host is the host in which the parasite reaches sexual maturity and reproduces. An intermediate host is a host in which the parasite undergoes asexual development or larval stages. Some parasites require a vector (e.g., an insect) for transmission between hosts. Parasite classification is broad, encompassing a diverse range of organisms. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic parasites. They are further classified into: Amoebae (move by pseudopodia, e.g., Entamoeba histolytica), Flagellates (move by flagella, e.g., Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis), Sporozoans (form spores, often with complex life cycles, e.g., Plasmodium species, Toxoplasma gondii), and Ciliates (move by cilia, e.g., Balantidium coli, rarely a human pathogen). Helminths are multicellular parasitic worms. They are divided into: Nematodes (roundworms, cylindrical body, e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworms, Enterobius vermicularis), Trematodes (flukes, flattened leaf-like body, e.g., Schistosoma species), and Cestodes (tapeworms, segmented body, e.g., Taenia species). Ectoparasites live on the external surface of the host (e.g., lice, fleas, ticks, mites). Parasite-host interactions involve a dynamic interplay between the parasite's virulence factors and the host's immune response. Parasites have evolved various mechanisms to evade the host's immune system, including antigenic variation, intracellular survival, and suppression of immune responses. The host's immune response can be both protective (eliminating the parasite) and pathological (contributing to disease symptoms).

Major parasitic pathogens cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Plasmodium species (transmitted by mosquitoes) cause malaria, characterized by fever, chills, and anemia. Different Plasmodium species (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax) have varying severity and geographic distribution. Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic dysentery (bloody diarrhea) and liver abscesses. Giardia lamblia causes giardiasis, a diarrheal disease. Trichomonas vaginalis causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection. Toxoplasma gondii causes toxoplasmosis, which can be asymptomatic or cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women (congenital toxoplasmosis). Intestinal nematodes cause a variety of infections. Ascaris lumbricoides (large roundworm) causes ascariasis, often asymptomatic but can cause intestinal obstruction. Hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus) cause anemia due to blood loss. Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) causes perianal itching. Blood flukes (Schistosoma species) cause schistosomiasis (bilharzia), a chronic disease affecting the urinary or intestinal tract. Tapeworms (Taenia species) cause taeniasis, usually asymptomatic but can cause intestinal discomfort. Antiparasitic therapies target specific metabolic pathways or structures unique to the parasite. Antimalarial drugs (e.g., chloroquine, artemisinin derivatives) target different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Metronidazole is used to treat infections caused by Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Albendazole and mebendazole are broad-spectrum antihelminthic drugs used to treat intestinal nematode infections. Praziquantel is effective against trematodes and cestodes. The choice of antiparasitic drug depends on the specific parasite, the stage of infection, and the patient's condition. Antiparasitic drug resistance is a growing concern, particularly in malaria.
