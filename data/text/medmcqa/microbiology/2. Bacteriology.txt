Classification and identification of bacteria employ a combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods. Phenotypic methods rely on observable characteristics, including Gram staining (differentiating bacteria based on cell wall structure), morphology (shape, arrangement, presence of spores, capsules, flagella), biochemical tests (assessing metabolic capabilities, enzyme production), and growth characteristics on various media (selective, differential). Genotypic methods analyze the genetic makeup of bacteria. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a widely used technique, as this gene is highly conserved within species but contains variable regions allowing for differentiation. Whole-genome sequencing provides the complete genetic information, enabling detailed comparisons and identification of virulence factors or antibiotic resistance genes. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight) identifies bacteria based on their protein profiles, providing rapid and accurate results. Bacterial taxonomy is a hierarchical system, classifying bacteria into domains (Bacteria and Archaea), phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species. Medically important bacteria are distributed across various phyla, including Proteobacteria (containing many Gram-negative pathogens like Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas), Firmicutes (including Gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium), Actinobacteria (including Mycobacterium), and Bacteroidetes (major components of the gut microbiota). The normal flora (microbiota) comprises the microorganisms that reside on and within the human body without causing disease under normal circumstances. These communities vary in composition depending on the body site (skin, mouth, gut, vagina) and contribute to host health by competing with pathogens, aiding in digestion, and synthesizing vitamins. Disruptions in the normal flora (dysbiosis) can lead to increased susceptibility to infections.

Mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis involve a complex interplay between bacterial virulence factors and host defenses. Adherence is the initial step, where bacteria attach to host cells or tissues, often mediated by pili (fimbriae), adhesins (surface proteins), or capsules. Invasion involves entry into host cells, facilitated by enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix or induce endocytosis. Toxin production is a major virulence mechanism. Exotoxins are secreted proteins that damage host cells, exhibiting diverse activities (e.g., neurotoxins, cytotoxins, enterotoxins). Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, released upon cell lysis and triggering a strong inflammatory response, potentially leading to sepsis. Immune evasion strategies allow bacteria to avoid or suppress the host's immune system. Capsules prevent phagocytosis, antigenic variation alters surface antigens to evade antibody recognition, and intracellular survival allows bacteria to reside within host cells, shielded from immune effectors. Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive coccus, a common cause of skin infections (abscesses, impetigo), wound infections, pneumonia, and food poisoning. It produces numerous virulence factors, including toxins (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, enterotoxins), enzymes (coagulase, hyaluronidase), and surface proteins promoting adherence and immune evasion. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major concern due to its resistance to many antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive diplococcus, a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. Its capsule is a major virulence factor, preventing phagocytosis. Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative rod, a normal inhabitant of the gut but certain strains (pathotypes) cause various diseases. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) causes traveler's diarrhea, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) produces Shiga toxin, causing bloody diarrhea and potentially hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacillus, the causative agent of tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs. It survives within macrophages, forming granulomas. Salmonella species are Gram-negative rods, causing salmonellosis (food poisoning) and typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi). Clostridium species are Gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic rods. Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum toxin, a potent neurotoxin causing botulism. Clostridium tetani produces tetanus toxin, causing tetanus (lockjaw). Clostridium perfringens causes gas gangrene and food poisoning. Antibiotic resistance mechanisms are diverse, including enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic (e.g., beta-lactamases hydrolyzing penicillins), modification of the antibiotic target (e.g., altered penicillin-binding proteins in MRSA), efflux pumps actively removing antibiotics from the cell, and reduced permeability of the cell membrane preventing antibiotic entry. These details about each pathogen must be mastered for any comprehensive microbiology examination.
