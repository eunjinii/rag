The innate immune response provides immediate, non-specific defense against microbial pathogens. Phagocytosis is a key process, where phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages) engulf and destroy microbes. Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells, rapidly recruited to sites of infection. Macrophages reside in tissues and play a role in phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and cytokine production. Natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill infected or cancerous cells without prior sensitization. Inflammation is a localized response to tissue injury or infection, characterized by redness, swelling, heat, and pain. It involves vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection. The complement system is a cascade of plasma proteins that can be activated by different pathways (classical, alternative, lectin). Activation leads to opsonization (coating of microbes for enhanced phagocytosis), formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) causing cell lysis, and recruitment of inflammatory cells. The adaptive immune response is specific, develops over time, and exhibits immunological memory. Humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies (immunoglobulins) produced by B lymphocytes (B cells). Antibodies bind to specific antigens (molecules recognized as foreign), neutralizing pathogens, opsonizing them for phagocytosis, and activating complement. There are five classes of antibodies: IgG (most abundant in serum, crosses the placenta), IgM (first antibody produced during an infection), IgA (found in mucosal secretions), IgE (involved in allergic reactions and defense against parasites), and IgD (function less clear). Cell-mediated immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes (T cells). Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) secrete cytokines that activate other immune cells, including B cells and macrophages. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) directly kill infected cells expressing foreign antigens on their surface. Immunological memory is the ability of the adaptive immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to a previously encountered antigen. Upon first exposure to an antigen (primary response), B cells and T cells differentiate into effector cells and memory cells. Upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen (secondary response), memory cells rapidly differentiate into effector cells, providing a faster and stronger response.

Vaccines exploit the principles of immunological memory to induce protective immunity against specific pathogens. Vaccines contain antigens derived from the pathogen (e.g., weakened or inactivated pathogens, subunit vaccines containing purified antigens, toxoid vaccines containing inactivated toxins, mRNA vaccines). Vaccination stimulates a primary immune response, generating memory B cells and T cells. Upon subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen, the memory cells provide a rapid and effective secondary response, preventing or reducing the severity of disease. Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened versions of the pathogen that can replicate but do not cause disease. Inactivated vaccines contain killed pathogens. Subunit vaccines contain specific antigens from the pathogen (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides). Toxoid vaccines contain inactivated bacterial toxins. mRNA vaccines contain mRNA encoding a viral antigen, which is translated into protein within host cells, triggering an immune response. Herd immunity occurs when a large proportion of the population is immune to a pathogen, providing indirect protection to non-immune individuals by reducing the spread of the pathogen. The threshold for herd immunity varies depending on the pathogen's transmissibility. The effectiveness of vaccines, and understanding how the vaccines work, is essential for the control of infectious diseases. This section of immunology is very connected with Microbiology; pathogens are recognized, and neutralized by the immune system.
