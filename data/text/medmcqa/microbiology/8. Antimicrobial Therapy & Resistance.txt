Specimen collection and processing are crucial for accurate microbiological diagnosis. The type of specimen collected depends on the suspected site of infection, and common specimens include blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue biopsies. Proper collection techniques are essential to avoid contamination and ensure the viability of the microorganisms. Sterile containers and appropriate collection methods (e.g., clean-catch midstream urine, induced sputum) are used. Transport media are used to preserve the viability of microorganisms during transport to the laboratory. Specimen processing methods vary depending on the suspected pathogen and the diagnostic tests to be performed. Direct examination (e.g., microscopy) can provide rapid preliminary information. Culture-based methods are used to isolate and grow microorganisms. Molecular methods are used to detect microbial nucleic acids.

Microbial identification employs a variety of techniques. Microscopy is a fundamental tool. Gram staining differentiates bacteria based on their cell wall structure (Gram-positive bacteria stain purple, Gram-negative bacteria stain pink). Acid-fast staining is used to detect Mycobacterium species, which have a waxy cell wall that resists Gram staining. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining uses fluorescently labeled antibodies to detect specific antigens on the surface of microorganisms. Culture-based methods involve growing microorganisms on artificial media. Selective media inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms while allowing others to grow. Differential media allow distinguishing between different types of microorganisms based on their metabolic characteristics. Biochemical tests assess the enzymatic activities of microorganisms, aiding in their identification (e.g., catalase test, oxidase test, sugar fermentation tests). Immunological methods detect microbial antigens or antibodies produced by the host. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a widely used technique for detecting antigens or antibodies in serum or other body fluids. Agglutination tests involve the clumping of particles (e.g., bacteria or latex beads) coated with antigens or antibodies. Lateral flow assays are rapid, point-of-care tests that use antibodies to detect specific antigens (e.g., rapid strep test). Molecular methods are increasingly used for rapid and accurate microbial identification. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies specific DNA sequences, allowing detection of even small numbers of microorganisms. Real-time PCR allows quantification of the amount of DNA. Sequencing of microbial DNA (e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequencing for bacteria, ITS sequencing for fungi) provides definitive identification. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry) identifies microorganisms based on their protein profiles, offering rapid and accurate results. Each method used has strengths and limitations with respect to sensitivity and specificity.
