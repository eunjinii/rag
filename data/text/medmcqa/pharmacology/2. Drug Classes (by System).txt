Cardiovascular drugs encompass a wide range of medications used to treat conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. Antihypertensives are used to lower blood pressure and are categorized into several classes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril) block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, reducing blood pressure and afterload. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (e.g., losartan, valsartan) block the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors, producing similar effects to ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol) block beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing heart rate and contractility, thereby lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen demand. Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, diltiazem) block calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, causing vasodilation and reducing heart rate and contractility. Diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) increase sodium and water excretion by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and blood pressure. Antiarrhythmics are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and are classified based on their mechanism of action (Vaughan Williams classification). Class I drugs are sodium channel blockers (e.g., lidocaine, flecainide), Class II are beta-blockers, Class III are potassium channel blockers (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and Class IV are calcium channel blockers. Drugs for heart failure are used to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of heart failure. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta-blockers are cornerstone therapies. Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, increases myocardial contractility but has a narrow therapeutic index. Diuretics are used to relieve fluid overload. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone) reduce sodium and water retention and have shown mortality benefit. Antithrombotics are used to prevent and treat blood clots. Anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs] like rivaroxaban, apixaban) interfere with the coagulation cascade. Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) inhibit platelet aggregation. Lipid-lowering drugs, primarily statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin), reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Other lipid-lowering drugs include bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, and ezetimibe.

Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs affect the brain and spinal cord, treating a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Anesthetics induce a loss of sensation and consciousness. General anesthetics (e.g., propofol, sevoflurane) are used for surgical procedures and produce unconsciousness, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. Local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, bupivacaine) block nerve conduction and produce a localized loss of sensation. Analgesics relieve pain. Opioids (e.g., morphine, fentanyl) act on opioid receptors in the CNS and are potent analgesics used for moderate to severe pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and providing analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects. Antidepressants are used to treat depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) selectively block the reuptake of serotonin, increasing its availability in the synapse. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine) also block serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake but have more side effects due to their interaction with other receptors. Antipsychotics are used to treat psychosis, primarily in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) (e.g., haloperidol, chlorpromazine) primarily block dopamine D2 receptors. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine) have a broader receptor profile, blocking both dopamine and serotonin receptors, and generally have fewer extrapyramidal side effects. Anxiolytics and hypnotics are used to treat anxiety and insomnia, respectively. Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam) enhance the effects of GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon) act more selectively on GABA-A receptors. Drugs for neurodegenerative diseases aim to slow disease progression and manage symptoms. For Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine) increase acetylcholine levels in the brain. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also used. For Parkinson's disease, levodopa, a precursor to dopamine, is used in combination with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa) to increase dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole) directly stimulate dopamine receptors. Drugs for epilepsy (anticonvulsants) are used to prevent or reduce seizures. They act through various mechanisms, including enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates), blocking sodium channels (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine), blocking calcium channels (e.g., ethosuximide), or other mechanisms (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine).

Antimicrobial agents are used to treat infections caused by microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Antibiotics specifically target bacteria. Beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems) inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Macrolides (e.g., erythromycin, azithromycin) inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin) also inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, and are often used for serious Gram-negative infections. Quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for DNA replication and transcription. Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline) inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Other antibiotics include sulfonamides (inhibit folate synthesis), vancomycin (inhibits cell wall synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria), and metronidazole (effective against anaerobic bacteria and some parasites). Antivirals target viruses. They act at various stages of the viral life cycle, including viral entry, replication, and release. Examples include neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir) for influenza, nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (e.g., acyclovir for herpes viruses, tenofovir for HIV), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, darunavir for HIV). Antifungals target fungi. They often target the fungal cell membrane or cell wall. Azoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole) inhibit ergosterol synthesis, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. Polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B) bind to ergosterol, disrupting membrane integrity. Echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin) inhibit fungal cell wall synthesis. Antiparasitics target parasites, including protozoa and helminths (worms). Examples include metronidazole (also an antibiotic) for amoebiasis and giardiasis, mebendazole and albendazole for helminth infections, and chloroquine and artemisinin derivatives for malaria. Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are diverse and include enzymatic inactivation of the drug, alteration of the drug target, decreased drug uptake, and increased drug efflux. Antimicrobial stewardship programs promote the judicious use of antimicrobials to minimize the development of resistance.

Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs are used to treat conditions characterized by inflammation and/or dysregulation of the immune system. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever. Non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, while selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) primarily inhibit COX-2, which is induced during inflammation. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone) are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. They bind to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammation through multiple mechanisms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Conventional DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine) have diverse mechanisms of action, often involving suppression of immune cell function. Biologic DMARDs are genetically engineered proteins that target specific components of the immune system. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (e.g., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) block the action of TNF, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) block the action of IL-6, another pro-inflammatory cytokine. Other biologic agents target other cytokines or immune cells (e.g., abatacept, rituximab). Immunosuppressants are used to suppress the immune system, often to prevent organ transplant rejection or treat autoimmune diseases. Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus) block the activation of T cells. mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus) inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Mycophenolate mofetil inhibits purine synthesis, suppressing lymphocyte proliferation.

Endocrine drugs are used to treat disorders of the endocrine system, which involves glands that produce hormones. Hormones and hormone antagonists are used to replace deficient hormones, inhibit excessive hormone production, or block hormone action. Insulin is used to treat diabetes mellitus, replacing deficient insulin in type 1 diabetes and supplementing insulin action in type 2 diabetes. Different insulin preparations have varying onset and duration of action. Oral antidiabetic drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Metformin, a biguanide, decreases hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. Sulfonylureas (e.g., glipizide, glyburide) stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (e.g., pioglitazone) increase insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, saxagliptin) inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4, an enzyme that degrades incretin hormones, which stimulate insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion. SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) inhibit sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the kidneys, increasing glucose excretion in the urine. Drugs for osteoporosis are used to increase bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate) inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits RANK ligand, a key regulator of osteoclast formation and activity. Teriparatide, a recombinant parathyroid hormone, stimulates bone formation. Drugs for thyroid disorders are used to treat hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). Levothyroxine, a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), is used to treat hypothyroidism. Antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil) inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and are used to treat hyperthyroidism. Oral contraceptives contain synthetic estrogen and/or progestin and are used for contraception, as well as to manage other conditions like dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. They primarily act by suppressing ovulation. Corticosteroids (as discussed above) are also endocrine drugs used for their potent anti-inflammatory effect.

Chemotherapeutic agents, used in cancer treatment, are designed to kill or inhibit the growth of cancer cells. They often target rapidly dividing cells, which is a characteristic of many cancer cells, but this also affects normal rapidly dividing cells, leading to side effects. Alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, cisplatin) damage DNA by adding alkyl groups to DNA bases, preventing DNA replication and transcription. Antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis by mimicking normal cellular metabolites. Plant alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, paclitaxel) disrupt microtubule function, which is essential for cell division. Antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, bleomycin) used in cancer chemotherapy have various mechanisms of action, often involving DNA damage or interference with DNA replication. Targeted therapies are designed to specifically target molecules or pathways that are dysregulated in cancer cells. Kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib, erlotinib) block the activity of specific kinases, which are enzymes that regulate cell growth and signaling. Monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab, rituximab) bind to specific proteins on cancer cells, triggering immune responses or blocking their function. Immunotherapy harnesses the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) block immune checkpoints, releasing the brakes on the immune system and allowing T cells to attack cancer cells. Hormonal therapy is used for hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer. Antiestrogens (e.g., tamoxifen) block estrogen receptors in breast cancer, while antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide) block androgen receptors in prostate cancer.

Gastrointestinal (GI) drugs are used to treat disorders of the digestive system. Antacids (e.g., aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate) neutralize gastric acid, providing relief from heartburn and indigestion. H2 receptor antagonists (e.g., ranitidine, famotidine) block histamine H2 receptors on parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole) are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, blocking the H+/K+ ATPase pump in parietal cells. They are used for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and other acid-related disorders. Laxatives are used to treat constipation. Bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., psyllium) increase stool bulk and promote peristalsis. Osmotic laxatives (e.g., lactulose, polyethylene glycol) draw water into the intestine, softening the stool. Stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, senna) increase intestinal motility. Antidiarrheals are used to treat diarrhea. Opioid receptor agonists (e.g., loperamide) decrease intestinal motility. Bismuth subsalicylate has antisecretory and antimicrobial effects. Drugs for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, aim to reduce inflammation in the gut. Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine) have anti-inflammatory effects. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) are used for acute flares. Immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) and biologic agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab) are used for more severe or refractory disease.

Respiratory drugs are used to treat conditions affecting the lungs and airways. Bronchodilators relax airway smooth muscle, opening up the airways and making it easier to breathe. Beta2-agonists (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol) stimulate beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation. Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol) provide rapid relief of bronchospasm, while long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol) provide longer-lasting bronchodilation and are often used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium, tiotropium) block muscarinic receptors in the airways, reducing bronchoconstriction. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide) reduce airway inflammation and are a cornerstone of asthma management. They are also used in COPD, often in combination with LABAs. Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast, zafirlukast) block the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators involved in asthma and allergic rhinitis. Anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab), a monoclonal antibody, binds to IgE, reducing allergic responses and is used for severe allergic asthma. Drugs for pulmonary hypertension are used to lower pulmonary artery pressure and improve symptoms. Endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g., bosentan, ambrisentan), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil), and prostacyclin analogs (e.g., epoprostenol, iloprost) are used.
