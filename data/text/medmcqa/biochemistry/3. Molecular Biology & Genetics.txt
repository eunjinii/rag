DNA replication is the process of accurately copying the entire genome prior to cell division. It is semiconservative, meaning each new DNA double helix consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. DNA polymerases are the enzymes that synthesize DNA, adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing DNA strand, using the parental strand as a template. DNA polymerase requires a primer (a short RNA sequence) to initiate synthesis. Replication proceeds bidirectionally from origins of replication. The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction. The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short fragments called Okazaki fragments, also in the 5' to 3' direction. DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from degradation and preventing fusion with other chromosomes. Telomerase is an enzyme that adds telomeric repeats, maintaining telomere length in germ cells and some stem cells. DNA repair mechanisms correct errors that occur during replication or damage caused by environmental factors. Mismatch repair corrects mismatched base pairs that escape the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase. Base excision repair removes damaged or modified bases. Nucleotide excision repair removes bulky DNA lesions, such as pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation. Double-strand break repair repairs breaks in both strands of DNA, either by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ, an error-prone process) or homologous recombination (HR, a more accurate process using a homologous chromosome as a template). DNA damage and mutations can lead to various consequences, including cell death, uncontrolled cell growth (cancer), and inherited genetic disorders.

Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template. RNA polymerases are the enzymes that catalyze transcription. In eukaryotes, there are three main types of RNA polymerase: RNA polymerase I (synthesizes rRNA), RNA polymerase II (synthesizes mRNA and some small RNAs), and RNA polymerase III (synthesizes tRNA and 5S rRNA). Promoters are DNA sequences that signal the start of transcription. Enhancers are DNA sequences that increase the rate of transcription. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to promoters and enhancers, regulating gene expression. mRNA processing occurs in eukaryotes. A 5' cap (a modified guanine nucleotide) is added to the 5' end of the mRNA, protecting it from degradation and aiding in translation initiation. Splicing removes introns (non-coding sequences) from the pre-mRNA and joins exons (coding sequences) together. Alternative splicing allows a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms. A poly(A) tail (a string of adenine nucleotides) is added to the 3' end of the mRNA, enhancing stability and translation. RNA editing involves changing the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule after transcription. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA molecules that are not translated into protein but have various regulatory functions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs that bind to target mRNAs, leading to translational repression or mRNA degradation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have diverse roles in gene regulation, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

Translation is the process of protein synthesis, where the information encoded in mRNA is used to assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Ribosomes are large ribonucleoprotein complexes that are the sites of protein synthesis. They consist of two subunits: a large subunit and a small subunit. tRNA (transfer RNA) molecules are adaptors that link codons in mRNA to specific amino acids. Each tRNA has an anticodon that base-pairs with a complementary codon in mRNA and carries a specific amino acid attached to its 3' end. The genetic code is a set of rules that specifies the correspondence between codons (three-nucleotide sequences in mRNA) and amino acids. There are 64 codons, 61 of which code for amino acids, and 3 of which are stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA). The start codon is AUG, which also codes for methionine. Translation proceeds in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation involves the assembly of the ribosome, mRNA, and the initiator tRNA (carrying methionine) at the start codon. Elongation involves the sequential addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain, as tRNAs bring their corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, guided by codon-anticodon pairing. Termination occurs when a stop codon is reached, releasing the completed polypeptide chain. Post-translational modifications are chemical modifications of proteins after translation, influencing their function, localization, and stability. These modifications include phosphorylation (addition of phosphate groups), glycosylation (addition of sugar molecules), acetylation (addition of acetyl groups), and ubiquitination (addition of ubiquitin, targeting proteins for degradation). Protein folding is the process by which a polypeptide chain acquires its three-dimensional structure. Chaperone proteins assist in protein folding, preventing aggregation and promoting correct folding. Protein targeting and trafficking involve directing proteins to their correct cellular locations (e.g., cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum). Signal peptides are short amino acid sequences that direct proteins to specific organelles.

Gene regulation controls the expression of genes, ensuring that proteins are produced at the appropriate time and in the appropriate amounts. In prokaryotes, gene regulation often occurs at the level of transcription. Operons are clusters of genes that are transcribed together as a single mRNA, often involved in a related metabolic pathway. The lac operon in E. coli controls the expression of genes involved in lactose metabolism. It is regulated by the presence of lactose and glucose. The trp operon in E. coli controls the expression of genes involved in tryptophan synthesis. It is regulated by the presence of tryptophan. In eukaryotes, gene regulation is more complex and can occur at multiple levels: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational. Transcription factors (activators and repressors) bind to specific DNA sequences (enhancers and silencers) to regulate transcription. Chromatin remodeling involves altering the structure of chromatin (DNA and associated proteins) to make DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases) is generally associated with gene silencing. Histone modification (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) alters chromatin structure and gene expression. X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals involves silencing one of the two X chromosomes in each cell. Genomic imprinting involves silencing one allele of a gene, depending on whether it was inherited from the mother or the father. These molecular processes are the foundation of all cellular processes, and fundamental to understanding normal physiology and disease states.
