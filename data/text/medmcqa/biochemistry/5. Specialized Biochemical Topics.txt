Blood biochemistry encompasses the study of the chemical components of blood and their clinical significance. Plasma proteins, synthesized primarily in the liver, perform diverse functions. Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, maintaining osmotic pressure and transporting various substances. Globulins include antibodies (immunoglobulins) and transport proteins. Fibrinogen is a clotting factor. Hemoglobin, found within red blood cells, is responsible for oxygen transport. It is a tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta globin chains, each containing a heme group that binds oxygen. Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders affecting hemoglobin structure or synthesis, such as sickle cell anemia (caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene) and thalassemias (caused by reduced synthesis of alpha or beta globin chains). Blood clotting (coagulation) is a complex cascade of enzymatic reactions that leads to the formation of a fibrin clot. The coagulation cascade involves intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, both converging on the common pathway, which leads to the activation of thrombin. Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, forming the clot. Blood group antigens are carbohydrate or protein structures on the surface of red blood cells, determining blood type. The ABO system is based on the presence or absence of A and B antigens. The Rh system is based on the presence or absence of the D antigen. Acid-base balance is tightly regulated to maintain blood pH within a narrow range (7.35-7.45). Buffer systems (bicarbonate, phosphate, proteins) help maintain pH. The lungs and kidneys play crucial roles in regulating acid-base balance. Respiratory acidosis is caused by impaired ventilation, leading to increased CO2 levels. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation, leading to decreased CO2 levels. Metabolic acidosis is caused by an accumulation of acid or loss of bicarbonate. Metabolic alkalosis is caused by a loss of acid or gain of bicarbonate. Electrolyte balance is essential for various physiological processes. Sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) are the major electrolytes in blood. Clinical chemistry tests are used to assess organ function and diagnose disease. Liver function tests (LFTs) measure levels of enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) and bilirubin, indicating liver damage. Kidney function tests measure creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), reflecting kidney function. Cardiac markers (e.g., troponin, CK-MB) are released into the bloodstream during myocardial infarction.

Immunology, from a biochemical perspective, focuses on the molecular mechanisms of the immune system. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are Y-shaped proteins produced by B cells that recognize and bind to specific antigens. They consist of two heavy chains and two light chains, with variable regions that determine antigen specificity. There are five classes of antibodies: IgG (most abundant in serum, crosses the placenta), IgM (first antibody produced during an infection), IgA (found in mucosal secretions), IgE (involved in allergic reactions and defense against parasites), and IgD (function less clear). Antigen-antibody interactions involve non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions). Affinity refers to the strength of binding between a single antibody binding site and an antigen. Avidity refers to the overall strength of binding between an antibody and an antigen, taking into account multiple binding sites. The complement system is a cascade of plasma proteins that can be activated by different pathways (classical, alternative, lectin). Activation leads to opsonization (coating of microbes for enhanced phagocytosis), formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) causing cell lysis, and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Cytokines and chemokines are signaling molecules that regulate immune responses. Cytokines mediate communication between immune cells, while chemokines attract immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a set of genes that encode cell-surface proteins involved in antigen presentation. MHC class I molecules present antigens to CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells). MHC class II molecules present antigens to CD4+ T cells (helper T cells). T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways are crucial for T cell and B cell activation. Immunological assays are used to detect and quantify antigens or antibodies. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a widely used technique. Western blotting detects specific proteins separated by electrophoresis. Flow cytometry analyzes cells based on their size, granularity, and expression of surface markers.

Neurochemistry deals with the biochemical processes occurring in the nervous system. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons at synapses. They are synthesized in the presynaptic neuron, stored in vesicles, and released into the synaptic cleft upon stimulation. After release, neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, triggering a response. Neurotransmitters are then removed from the synaptic cleft by reuptake into the presynaptic neuron, enzymatic degradation, or diffusion. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction, memory, and learning. It is synthesized from choline and acetyl-CoA and degraded by acetylcholinesterase. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, and reward. It is synthesized from tyrosine. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in mood, sleep, and appetite. It is synthesized from tryptophan. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Receptors for neurotransmitters can be ionotropic (ligand-gated ion channels) or metabotropic (G protein-coupled receptors). Signal transduction in neurons involves changes in membrane potential and intracellular signaling cascades. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons. Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation of amyloid plaques (aggregates of beta-amyloid protein) and neurofibrillary tangles (aggregates of tau protein). Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Myelin is a fatty sheath that insulates axons, increasing the speed of nerve impulse transmission.

Endocrinology, from a biochemical perspective, focuses on the synthesis, secretion, action, and regulation of hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that are produced by endocrine glands and travel through the bloodstream to target cells. Peptide hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon, growth hormone) are synthesized as preprohormones and processed into active hormones. Steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, estrogen) are derived from cholesterol. Amino acid-derived hormones (e.g., epinephrine, thyroxine) are synthesized from amino acids. Hormone receptors can be located on the cell surface (for peptide hormones and catecholamines) or inside the cell (for steroid hormones and thyroid hormones). Hormone signaling pathways involve various mechanisms, including G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and intracellular receptors. Feedback regulation is crucial for maintaining hormone levels within a narrow range. The hypothalamic-pituitary-target organ axes are a major regulatory system in the endocrine system. Endocrine disorders result from hormone deficiencies or excesses. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). Thyroid disorders include hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).

Clinical enzymology focuses on the use of enzymes as diagnostic tools. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions. Enzyme kinetics describes the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The Michaelis-Menten equation describes the relationship between substrate concentration and reaction velocity. Enzyme regulation can occur through various mechanisms, including allosteric regulation, covalent modification, and feedback inhibition. Isoenzymes are different forms of an enzyme that catalyze the same reaction but have different kinetic properties or tissue distribution. Diagnostic enzymes are used as markers of tissue damage. For example, elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood indicate muscle damage. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicate liver damage. Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) indicate liver or bone disease. Enzyme inhibitors can be competitive (bind to the active site) or non-competitive (bind to a site other than the active site). Enzyme assays are used to measure enzyme activity in biological samples. The principles learned throughout all sections of biochemistry can be tested in relation to these specialized topics.
