Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, possess a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a unique side chain (R group). This R group determines the amino acid's properties. Amino acids exist as zwitterions at physiological pH, carrying both positive and negative charges. The 20 standard amino acids are classified based on their side chain properties: nonpolar (aliphatic or aromatic), polar uncharged, positively charged (basic), and negatively charged (acidic). Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained from the diet. Peptide bonds link amino acids together, forming a polypeptide chain. This bond is formed through a dehydration reaction between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another. Protein structure is hierarchical. Primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids. Secondary structure refers to local folding patterns, including alpha-helices (spiral structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds) and beta-sheets (extended structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent polypeptide chains). Tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, determined by interactions between R groups (hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, ionic bonds). Quaternary structure arises from the association of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) to form a functional protein complex. Protein folding is a complex process, often assisted by chaperone proteins, which prevent aggregation and promote correct folding. Misfolded proteins can cause diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (amyloid plaques) and prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). Proteins perform diverse functions, including enzymatic catalysis, structural support (collagen, keratin), hormone signaling (insulin, growth hormone), receptor binding (ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors), and transport (hemoglobin, membrane transporters).

Carbohydrates, also known as saccharides, are organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a 1:2:1 ratio. Monosaccharides are the simplest sugars, including glucose (a primary energy source), fructose (fruit sugar), and galactose (a component of lactose). Disaccharides are formed by the linkage of two monosaccharides via a glycosidic bond, including sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (glucose + glucose). Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides, serving as energy storage molecules (starch in plants, glycogen in animals) or structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in fungi). Glycoproteins are proteins with covalently attached carbohydrate chains, playing roles in cell-cell recognition, immune response, and protein folding. Glycolipids are lipids with covalently attached carbohydrate chains, important components of cell membranes. Carbohydrate metabolism is tightly regulated. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, generating ATP. Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. Glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) stores glucose as glycogen, while glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) releases glucose. Blood group antigens (ABO system) are carbohydrate structures on the surface of red blood cells, determining blood type.

Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, including fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fatty acids are long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group at one end. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between carbon atoms, while unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double bonds. Essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. Triglycerides (fats and oils) are composed of glycerol and three fatty acids, serving as a major energy storage form. Phospholipids are composed of glycerol, two fatty acids, a phosphate group, and a polar head group. They are the major components of cell membranes, forming a lipid bilayer. Steroids have a characteristic four-ring structure. Cholesterol is a crucial component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol, testosterone, estrogen) and bile acids. Eicosanoids are signaling molecules derived from arachidonic acid, including prostaglandins (involved in inflammation and pain), thromboxanes (involved in blood clotting), and leukotrienes (involved in allergic reactions and inflammation). Lipid metabolism involves several key pathways. Beta-oxidation is the breakdown of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA, generating ATP. Fatty acid synthesis is the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. Lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, HDL) transport lipids in the bloodstream. Chylomicrons transport dietary triglycerides. VLDL transports triglycerides synthesized in the liver. LDL ("bad cholesterol") delivers cholesterol to cells. HDL ("good cholesterol") removes excess cholesterol from cells.

Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are polymers of nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine in DNA, uracil in RNA), a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), and a phosphate group. DNA is a double helix, with two antiparallel strands held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine). RNA is typically single-stranded and can fold into complex structures. There are different types of RNA: mRNA (messenger RNA, carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes), tRNA (transfer RNA, carries amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA, a component of ribosomes). DNA replication is the process of copying DNA, ensuring accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division. It is a semiconservative process, where each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, catalyzed by RNA polymerase. Translation is the synthesis of protein from an mRNA template, occurring on ribosomes. The genetic code specifies the correspondence between codons (three-nucleotide sequences in mRNA) and amino acids. Gene regulation controls the expression of genes, ensuring that proteins are produced at the right time and in the right amounts. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, which can have various effects on protein function. Recombinant DNA technology involves manipulating DNA sequences in vitro, enabling gene cloning, gene editing (CRISPR-Cas9), and the production of recombinant proteins (e.g., insulin).
