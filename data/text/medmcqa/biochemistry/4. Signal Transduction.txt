Cell signaling involves communication between cells, coordinating their activities and responses to the environment. Signaling molecules, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, act as ligands, binding to specific receptors. Receptors can be located on the cell surface (cell-surface receptors) or inside the cell (intracellular receptors). Cell-surface receptors typically bind hydrophilic ligands, while intracellular receptors bind hydrophobic ligands (e.g., steroid hormones) that can cross the cell membrane. Signal transduction pathways are intracellular signaling cascades initiated by receptor activation. These pathways often involve a series of protein-protein interactions and enzymatic reactions, ultimately leading to changes in cellular behavior. Second messengers are small intracellular signaling molecules that amplify and propagate the signal. Common second messengers include cyclic AMP (cAMP), cyclic GMP (cGMP), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and calcium ions (Ca2+). Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate proteins (add phosphate groups), often activating or inhibiting their activity. Protein phosphatases are enzymes that dephosphorylate proteins (remove phosphate groups), reversing the effects of kinases. Signal amplification occurs at multiple steps in a signaling pathway, allowing a small number of activated receptors to produce a large cellular response. Signal termination mechanisms are crucial to prevent overstimulation and ensure that the cell can respond to subsequent signals. These mechanisms include receptor desensitization, receptor internalization, and degradation of signaling molecules.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of cell-surface receptors that contain seven transmembrane alpha-helices. Upon ligand binding, GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G proteins (composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits). The alpha subunit binds GTP and activates or inhibits downstream effector proteins. Common effectors include adenylyl cyclase (which produces cAMP) and phospholipase C (PLC, which produces IP3 and DAG). Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by cAMP and phosphorylates various target proteins. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are cell-surface receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Upon ligand binding, RTKs dimerize and autophosphorylate tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins containing SH2 domains. The Ras-MAPK pathway is a major signaling pathway activated by RTKs. Ras is a small GTPase that activates a cascade of protein kinases: Raf, MEK, and ERK (MAP kinases). ERK phosphorylates various target proteins, including transcription factors, regulating cell growth and differentiation. The JAK-STAT pathway is activated by cytokine receptors. JAKs (Janus kinases) are tyrosine kinases associated with cytokine receptors. Upon cytokine binding, JAKs phosphorylate STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription). Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression. The TGF-beta signaling pathway is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and development. TGF-beta receptors are serine/threonine kinases. Upon ligand binding, they phosphorylate Smad proteins, which then regulate gene expression. Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors and LRP co-receptors. This activates Dishevelled, which inhibits a complex that degrades beta-catenin. Beta-catenin then translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Notch signaling is involved in cell fate determination. Notch is a transmembrane receptor. Upon ligand binding (Delta or Jagged), Notch undergoes proteolytic cleavage, releasing its intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Hedgehog signaling plays a role in embryonic development and tissue patterning. Hedgehog proteins bind to Patched (Ptc) receptors, relieving inhibition of Smoothened (Smo). Smo activates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of Gli transcription factors. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a tightly regulated process important for development and tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis signaling pathways involve caspases, a family of proteases that execute the cell death program. Intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for apoptosis exist. The NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by various stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines and pathogens. IκB proteins inhibit NF-κB. Upon stimulation, IκB is degraded, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. These pathways are all critical to normal physiology. Insulin signaling is essential, activating the PI3K-Akt pathway.

Insulin, released by pancreatic beta-cells, promotes glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis, while inhibiting gluconeogenesis and lipolysis. It binds to the insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Insulin receptor activation leads to autophosphorylation and the recruitment of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) proteins. IRS proteins activate the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway. PI3K generates PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate), which activates Akt (protein kinase B). Akt phosphorylates various downstream targets, mediating the metabolic effects of insulin. Glucagon signalling counteracts the effects of insulin. Glucagon, released by pancreatic alpha-cells, stimulates glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis, raising blood glucose levels. It signals through a G protein-coupled receptor.
