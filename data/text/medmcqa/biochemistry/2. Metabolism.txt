Bioenergetics is the study of energy transformations in living organisms. Gibbs free energy (ΔG) determines the spontaneity of a reaction. A negative ΔG indicates a spontaneous (exergonic) reaction, while a positive ΔG indicates a non-spontaneous (endergonic) reaction. ΔG is related to enthalpy (ΔH, heat change) and entropy (ΔS, disorder) by the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS (where T is temperature). ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of the cell. The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) releases energy that drives many cellular processes. Coupled reactions link energetically unfavorable reactions with favorable reactions (like ATP hydrolysis) to make the overall process spontaneous. Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, while reduction is the gain of electrons. Electron carriers, such as NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), accept and donate electrons in metabolic pathways. NAD+ is reduced to NADH, and FAD is reduced to FADH2. Metabolic pathways are series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that transform substrates into products. Catabolic pathways break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy (e.g., glycolysis). Anabolic pathways build complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy (e.g., gluconeogenesis). Metabolic pathways are tightly regulated through various mechanisms, including feedback inhibition (where the end product of a pathway inhibits an early enzyme in the pathway), allosteric regulation (where molecules bind to enzymes and alter their activity), and covalent modification (e.g., phosphorylation).

Carbohydrate metabolism is a central metabolic hub. Glycolysis, occurring in the cytoplasm, is the breakdown of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon molecule). It generates a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Key regulatory enzymes include hexokinase (catalyzes the first step, phosphorylation of glucose), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1, the major control point, catalyzes the committed step), and pyruvate kinase (catalyzes the final step). Gluconeogenesis, primarily in the liver, is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (e.g., pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, amino acids). It is essentially the reverse of glycolysis, but with different enzymes at irreversible steps. Gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are reciprocally regulated to prevent futile cycling. Glycogen metabolism involves the synthesis and breakdown of glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose, serving as a glucose storage molecule. Glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) is stimulated by insulin, and glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) is stimulated by glucagon and epinephrine. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) generates NADPH (used for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense) and ribose-5-phosphate (a precursor for nucleotide synthesis). The citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle, TCA cycle), occurring in the mitochondrial matrix, oxidizes acetyl-CoA (derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) to CO2, generating NADH, FADH2, and GTP (which is readily converted to ATP). Oxidative phosphorylation, occurring in the inner mitochondrial membrane, couples the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 to the synthesis of ATP. Electrons are passed down the electron transport chain (complexes I-IV), creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton gradient drives ATP synthase (complex V) to produce ATP (chemiosmotic theory). Regulation of blood glucose is crucial. Insulin, secreted by pancreatic beta cells in response to high blood glucose, stimulates glucose uptake by cells, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis. Glucagon, secreted by pancreatic alpha cells in response to low blood glucose, stimulates glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis.

Lipid metabolism encompasses the breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids, triglycerides, and other lipids. Beta-oxidation, occurring in the mitochondria, is the stepwise breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA molecules. Each round of beta-oxidation generates one molecule each of FADH2, NADH, and acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. Fatty acid synthesis, occurring in the cytoplasm, is essentially the reverse of beta-oxidation, building fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. Ketogenesis, occurring in the liver during periods of fasting or carbohydrate deprivation, is the production of ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone) from acetyl-CoA. Ketone bodies can be used as an alternative fuel source by the brain and other tissues. Cholesterol synthesis, a complex multistep pathway, occurs primarily in the liver. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme and a target for statin drugs (cholesterol-lowering drugs). Lipoprotein metabolism involves the transport of lipids in the bloodstream. Chylomicrons transport dietary triglycerides from the intestine to tissues. VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) transports triglycerides synthesized in the liver to tissues. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) delivers cholesterol to cells. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) removes excess cholesterol from cells and transports it back to the liver. Steroid hormone synthesis involves the conversion of cholesterol into various steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, estrogen) in specific tissues (adrenal glands, gonads).

Amino acid metabolism involves the breakdown and synthesis of amino acids. Transamination reactions transfer amino groups from amino acids to alpha-keto acids, catalyzed by aminotransferases (transaminases). Deamination reactions remove amino groups from amino acids, releasing ammonia. The urea cycle, occurring primarily in the liver, converts toxic ammonia into urea, which is excreted in the urine. Amino acid catabolism involves the breakdown of amino acids into intermediates that can enter the citric acid cycle or be used for gluconeogenesis. Glucogenic amino acids can be converted to glucose, while ketogenic amino acids can be converted to ketone bodies. Non-essential amino acids can be synthesized by the body from other molecules, while essential amino acids must be obtained from the diet. Amino acids are also precursors for various specialized products, including neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, GABA), hormones (e.g., epinephrine, thyroxine), and porphyrins (e.g., heme).

Nucleotide metabolism concerns the synthesis and degradation of purines (adenine, guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, uracil). Purine synthesis is a complex de novo pathway starting from ribose-5-phosphate. Pyrimidine synthesis is simpler, building the pyrimidine ring before attaching it to ribose-5-phosphate. Nucleotide degradation breaks down nucleotides into their constituent bases, sugars, and phosphate. Salvage pathways recycle purine and pyrimidine bases, re-synthesizing nucleotides. Regulation of nucleotide synthesis is tightly controlled to ensure adequate supplies for DNA and RNA synthesis. Disorders of nucleotide metabolism include Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a severe X-linked disorder caused by a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), leading to hyperuricemia and neurological problems), gout (caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in joints), and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. These pathways are essential for all living cells.
