General Medicine, often synonymous with Internal Medicine, is the foundation of adult medical care. It demands a broad knowledge base, strong clinical skills, and a patient-centered approach. Foundational principles start with patient-centered care and communication. Building rapport through active listening, empathy, and clear communication is paramount. Shared decision-making, involving patients in their care plans, respects autonomy and improves adherence. Cultural competency – understanding and respecting diverse backgrounds – is essential for equitable care. Health literacy considerations ensure effective communication with all patients. Motivational interviewing techniques help patients make positive behavioral changes. Delivering bad news requires sensitivity and support.

Clinical reasoning and the diagnostic process are central. This involves meticulous history taking, a thorough physical examination, and generating a differential diagnosis – a list of potential conditions. Appropriate diagnostic testing, guided by the differential, and interpreting results accurately are crucial. Evidence-based medicine – using the best available research to guide decisions – is the standard of care. Clinical problem solving means applying critical thinking to complex cases.

Medical ethics and professionalism are unwavering principles. Autonomy (respecting patient choices), beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice (ensuring fairness) are core tenets. Confidentiality (protecting patient information) is a legal and ethical obligation. Professionalism encompasses ethical conduct, integrity, and accountability. Recognizing and managing potential conflict of interest is also critical.

Preventive medicine and health promotion are integral to General Medicine. Screening for common diseases (cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes) using evidence-based guidelines is crucial. Maintaining up-to-date immunizations is essential. Lifestyle counseling (diet, exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation) addresses modifiable risk factors. Health education empowers patients to make informed choices.

Pharmacology and therapeutics require a deep understanding. Pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) describes how the body handles drugs. Pharmacodynamics describes drug mechanisms of action. Drug interactions, both potential and actual, must be considered. Adverse drug reactions (side effects) need to be recognized and managed. Prescribing principles involve choosing appropriate medications, dosages, and routes, while carefully managing polypharmacy (multiple medications). A grasp of biostatistics and epidemiology is critical, from basic statical concepts such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, p-value and confidence intervals to types of studies like observational, experimental, cohort and case-control. One should understand the bias and confounding factors in research and how to differentiate incidence and prevalence.

Systemic diseases form the bulk of General Medicine knowledge. Cardiovascular disease includes hypertension (diagnosis, treatment, complications), coronary artery disease (angina, myocardial infarction, management), heart failure (systolic and diastolic dysfunction, classification, treatment), arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardias), valvular heart disease (stenosis, regurgitation), peripheral artery disease (PAD) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Respiratory disease encompasses asthma (diagnosis, treatment, exacerbation management), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD: chronic bronchitis, emphysema, management), pneumonia (community-acquired, hospital-acquired, aspiration), pulmonary embolism (PE: diagnosis, treatment, prevention), lung cancer (screening, diagnosis, treatment), interstitial lung disease and pleural effusion.

Gastrointestinal disease includes gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD: diagnosis, treatment), peptic ulcer disease (diagnosis, treatment, H. pylori infection), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS: diagnosis, management), liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), pancreatitis (acute and chronic), gastrointestinal bleeding, and celiac disease.

Endocrine disorders involve hormone imbalances. Diabetes mellitus (type 1, type 2, gestational; diagnosis, treatment, complications) is a major focus. Thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules) are common. Adrenal disorders (Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease) and pituitary disorders (hypopituitarism, acromegaly) are less frequent but important. Calcium and bone disorders, including osteoporosis, are significant concerns, especially in older adults.

Renal disease includes acute kidney injury (AKI: causes, diagnosis, management), chronic kidney disease (CKD: stages, management, complications), glomerulonephritis (various types, diagnosis, treatment), nephrotic syndrome, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and kidney stones.

Neurologic disorders encountered in General Medicine include stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic; diagnosis, treatment, prevention), headache (migraine, tension, cluster), seizures and epilepsy (diagnosis, treatment), multiple sclerosis (MS: diagnosis, management), Parkinson's disease (diagnosis, treatment), dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, other types), and peripheral neuropathy.

Hematologic disorders encompass anemia (iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, hemolytic anemia), leukemia (acute and chronic), lymphoma (Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), coagulation disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease), thrombocytopenia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Infectious diseases are a constant concern. Bacterial infections (pneumonia, UTIs, skin/soft tissue infections, sepsis), viral infections (influenza, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, herpesviruses), fungal infections (candidiasis, aspergillosis), parasitic infections (malaria, giardiasis), tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) all fall under the purview of General Medicine. Antimicrobial stewardship – the judicious use of antibiotics – is crucial.

Rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders include rheumatoid arthritis (RA: diagnosis, treatment), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE: diagnosis, management), Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, vasculitis, and gout/pseudogout. These often involve chronic inflammation and multi-system involvement.

Oncology (cancer) is relevant to General Medicine through screening (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate cancer), understanding principles of cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy), and providing palliative care (symptom management, end-of-life care).

Mental health is an integral part of overall health. General internists often provide initial assessment and management for depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, and play a key role in screening for and addressing substance use disorders.

Special populations require tailored care. Women's health includes contraception, pregnancy (prenatal care, common complications), menopause, breast cancer screening (mammography), cervical cancer screening (Pap smears), and osteoporosis prevention/treatment. Men's health addresses prostate cancer screening (PSA testing), testicular cancer screening, erectile dysfunction, and androgen deficiency. Geriatric medicine focuses on the unique needs of older adults, including physiological changes of aging, polypharmacy, falls prevention, dementia, end-of-life care, and geriatric syndromes (frailty, delirium, incontinence). Adolescent medicine addresses puberty, mental health, substance use, and sexual health. LGBTQ+ health requires culturally competent care, understanding unique needs, including HIV prevention (PrEP and PEP), and transgender health (hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery). Global health considerations include travel medicine (pre-travel counseling, immunizations) and awareness of tropical diseases. Addiction medicine is important to make diagnosis, treatment and harm reduction strategies to any substance use disorders, such as alcohol, opioid and tobacco.

Clinical skills and procedures are essential. Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certification are mandatory. Common procedures include venipuncture (drawing blood), arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling, intravenous (IV) line placement, lumbar puncture, joint aspiration and injection, skin biopsy, electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, and wound care/suturing. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly used for rapid bedside assessment. This "last-minute" summary highlights the key areas of General Medicine. Remember that the breadth of knowledge required is vast, and continuous learning is essential. The ability to integrate information, apply clinical reasoning, and communicate effectively with patients are the hallmarks of a skilled general internist.
