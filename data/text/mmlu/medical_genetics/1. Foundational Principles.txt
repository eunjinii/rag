Mendelian Genetics focuses on the inheritance patterns of single-gene disorders, following predictable ratios based on the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and their subsequent combination during fertilization. Autosomal dominant disorders manifest when only one copy of the mutated allele is present, leading to a 50% recurrence risk in offspring if one parent is affected. Examples include Huntington's disease and neurofibromatosis type 1. Autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of the mutated allele for the phenotype to be expressed; thus, both parents must be carriers (heterozygous), resulting in a 25% recurrence risk for each child. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and phenylketonuria are classic examples. X-linked disorders involve genes located on the X chromosome. X-linked recessive conditions, like hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, predominantly affect males because they have only one X chromosome. Affected males transmit the mutated allele to all their daughters (who become carriers) but none of their sons. Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the allele to each child, with sons having a 50% chance of being affected and daughters a 50% chance of being carriers. X-linked dominant disorders, such as Rett syndrome and incontinentia pigmenti, are often lethal in males, while females exhibit variable expressivity due to X-inactivation. Pedigree analysis, a crucial tool in Mendelian genetics, visually represents family relationships and the inheritance of traits, allowing for the determination of inheritance patterns and risk assessment.

Non-Mendelian Inheritance encompasses inheritance patterns that deviate from Mendel's classic laws, often involving complex interactions or non-nuclear genetic material. Mitochondrial inheritance, exclusively maternal, arises from mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Because mtDNA lacks robust repair mechanisms, it accumulates mutations at a higher rate than nuclear DNA. Diseases like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) result from mtDNA mutations. Heteroplasmy, the presence of a mixture of normal and mutated mtDNA within a cell, contributes to the variable expressivity and penetrance of mitochondrial disorders. Genomic imprinting refers to the differential expression of genes depending on their parental origin. Certain genes are "silenced" (imprinted) during gametogenesis, either in the sperm or the egg, resulting in monoallelic expression. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are classic examples, both caused by defects in the same region of chromosome 15. PWS arises from the loss of the paternally expressed genes, while AS results from the loss of the maternally expressed genes. Trinucleotide repeat expansions involve the unstable expansion of repetitive DNA sequences, typically consisting of three nucleotides. These expansions can disrupt gene function and often exhibit anticipation, where the severity of the disease increases and/or the age of onset decreases in successive generations. Fragile X syndrome, caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene, and myotonic dystrophy, caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, are prominent examples. Mosaicism describes the presence of two or more genetically distinct cell populations within an individual, arising from a postzygotic mutation. The phenotypic consequences of mosaicism depend on the timing of the mutation, the tissues affected, and the proportion of cells carrying the mutation. Somatic mosaicism can lead to milder or segmental forms of genetic disorders, while germline mosaicism can result in the unexpected transmission of a genetic disorder from an unaffected parent. Mosaicism is observed across all inheritance patterns and can be very difficult to discover.

The Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance centers on the structure, function, and abnormalities of chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), each carrying a specific set of genes. Chromosomes are composed of DNA tightly coiled around histone proteins, forming chromatin. Karyotyping, a fundamental cytogenetic technique, allows for the visualization of chromosomes to detect numerical and structural abnormalities. Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, results from nondisjunction during meiosis, the failure of chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly. Trisomy, the presence of an extra chromosome (e.g., Down syndrome – trisomy 21), and monosomy, the absence of a chromosome (e.g., Turner syndrome – monosomy X), are common examples of aneuploidy. Structural chromosomal abnormalities involve alterations in the structure of one or more chromosomes. These include deletions (loss of a chromosome segment), duplications (extra copies of a chromosome segment), inversions (reversal of a chromosome segment), translocations (exchange of segments between non-homologous chromosomes), and ring chromosomes (formation of a circular chromosome). Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion) and chronic myeloid leukemia (Philadelphia chromosome – a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22) are examples of diseases caused by structural chromosomal abnormalities. Techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) provide higher resolution than traditional karyotyping, allowing for the detection of smaller chromosomal imbalances, including microdeletions and microduplications. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is another powerful tool for detecting copy number variations across the genome.

Population Genetics examines the distribution and changes in allele frequencies within and between populations, influenced by factors such as mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural selection. Allele frequencies describe the proportion of each allele at a particular locus in a population. The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a mathematical model for predicting genotype frequencies from allele frequencies in a population that is not evolving (i.e., no mutation, migration, genetic drift, or selection). Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium suggest that evolutionary forces are acting on the population. Mutation introduces new alleles into a population, providing the raw material for evolution. Migration (gene flow) involves the movement of alleles between populations, which can alter allele frequencies. Genetic drift refers to random fluctuations in allele frequencies due to chance events, particularly significant in small populations. Natural selection favors alleles that increase survival and reproduction, leading to adaptation. Population genetic studies often utilize large-scale databases, such as gnomAD and the 1000 Genomes Project, to catalog genetic variation across diverse populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful tools for identifying genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases, by comparing allele frequencies in cases (individuals with the trait/disease) and controls (individuals without the trait/disease). Statistical analyses, including measures of linkage disequilibrium (the non-random association of alleles at different loci), are crucial for interpreting GWAS results. Population genetics has implications for understanding disease prevalence, pharmacogenomics, ancestry testing, and evolutionary biology. For example, variations in drug metabolism genes (e.g., CYP enzymes) show significant differences in frequency across populations, influencing drug response.

DNA Structure and Replication form the molecular foundation of inheritance. DNA, a double helix composed of two antiparallel strands, carries the genetic instructions of an organism. Each strand consists of a sugar-phosphate backbone and nitrogenous bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine). Base pairing (A with T, and G with C) ensures accurate DNA replication. DNA replication is a semiconservative process, meaning that each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. The process begins at origins of replication, where the double helix unwinds. DNA polymerases, the key enzymes of replication, synthesize new DNA strands in the 5' to 3' direction, using the original strands as templates. Leading strand synthesis is continuous, while lagging strand synthesis occurs in short fragments (Okazaki fragments) that are later joined by DNA ligase. Proofreading mechanisms, intrinsic to DNA polymerases, minimize errors during replication. Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, protect against chromosome shortening during replication. Telomerase, a specialized enzyme, extends telomeres and is active in germ cells and some cancer cells. Understanding DNA structure and replication is crucial for comprehending the basis of mutations, DNA repair mechanisms, and the development of genetic technologies like PCR and DNA sequencing. Defects in DNA replication or repair can lead to genomic instability and disease, including cancer.

Gene Expression, encompassing transcription and translation, is the process by which the information encoded in DNA is used to synthesize functional gene products, primarily proteins. Transcription, the first step, involves the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template. RNA polymerase binds to a promoter region upstream of the gene and synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule (messenger RNA or mRNA). RNA processing in eukaryotes involves several modifications: capping (addition of a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5' end), splicing (removal of introns and joining of exons), and polyadenylation (addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3' end). These modifications enhance mRNA stability and facilitate translation. Translation, the second step, occurs on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, recognize codons (three-nucleotide sequences) on the mRNA. The ribosome facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids, synthesizing a polypeptide chain according to the genetic code. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Gene expression is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional control (by transcription factors), RNA processing, mRNA stability, and translational control. Dysregulation of gene expression can lead to various diseases, including cancer. Techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), Northern blotting, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are used to measure RNA levels, while Western blotting and proteomics are used to analyze protein expression. Understanding gene expression is critical for developing therapies that target gene regulation, such as RNA interference (RNAi) technologies.

Mutation and DNA Repair are fundamental processes that impact genome stability and contribute to genetic diversity and disease. Mutations are alterations in the DNA sequence, ranging from single nucleotide changes (point mutations) to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Point mutations include substitutions (transitions and transversions), insertions, and deletions. Frameshift mutations, caused by insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three, disrupt the reading frame and often lead to non-functional proteins. Missense mutations result in a codon change that specifies a different amino acid, potentially altering protein function. Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon, leading to truncated proteins. Splice site mutations disrupt the normal splicing of mRNA, leading to aberrant protein products. Mutations can arise spontaneously due to errors in DNA replication or be induced by mutagens, such as radiation or chemicals. DNA repair mechanisms are essential for maintaining genomic integrity. Several distinct pathways exist, each specialized for repairing specific types of DNA damage. Mismatch repair (MMR) corrects errors that occur during DNA replication. Base excision repair (BER) removes damaged or modified bases. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky lesions, such as those caused by UV radiation. Double-strand break repair (DSBR) repairs breaks that affect both DNA strands, using either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Defects in DNA repair pathways can lead to increased mutation rates and genomic instability, predisposing individuals to cancer. Inherited defects in DNA repair genes cause various syndromes, including Lynch syndrome (MMR defects), xeroderma pigmentosum (NER defects), and BRCA1/2-related cancers (HR defects). Understanding mutation and DNA repair is crucial for understanding the causes of genetic disorders and developing targeted therapies.

Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations in the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications influence how genes are read and expressed, playing critical roles in development, cellular differentiation, and disease. The major epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base (typically at CpG dinucleotides), is generally associated with gene silencing. Methylation patterns can be inherited through cell division, maintaining cellular identity. Histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, alter the structure of chromatin, making DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors. Acetylation of histones generally promotes gene expression, while deacetylation is associated with gene silencing. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), play diverse roles in gene regulation. miRNAs can bind to target mRNAs, leading to translational repression or mRNA degradation. lncRNAs can interact with chromatin-modifying complexes, influencing gene expression at the transcriptional level. Epigenetic modifications are dynamic and can be influenced by environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where altered DNA methylation and histone modification can silence tumor suppressor genes or activate oncogenes. Imprinting disorders, such as Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, are caused by epigenetic dysregulation of specific genes. Understanding epigenetics is crucial for developing therapies that target epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, which are used in cancer treatment. Techniques like chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), bisulfite sequencing, and RNA-Seq are used to study epigenetic modifications.
