DNA Structure and Replication are foundational to understanding molecular genetics. DNA's double helix structure, with its antiparallel strands and complementary base pairing (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine), is crucial for both information storage and replication fidelity. The sugar-phosphate backbone provides structural support, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases encodes the genetic information. DNA replication is a semiconservative process, initiated at specific sites called origins of replication. Helicases unwind the double helix, and single-stranded binding proteins prevent re-annealing. DNA polymerases are the key enzymes, synthesizing new DNA strands in the 5' to 3' direction using the original strands as templates. Leading strand synthesis is continuous, proceeding in the same direction as the replication fork. Lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous, occurring in short fragments called Okazaki fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase. DNA polymerases possess proofreading activity, excising incorrectly incorporated nucleotides, ensuring high replication accuracy. However, errors can still occur, leading to mutations. Telomeres, repetitive sequences at the ends of linear chromosomes, protect against chromosome shortening during replication. Telomerase, a specialized enzyme, adds telomeric repeats, particularly active in germ cells and cancer cells, preventing cellular senescence. Understanding DNA structure and replication is essential for comprehending mutation mechanisms, DNA repair pathways, and the development of molecular techniques like PCR and sequencing. Disruptions in these processes contribute to genetic instability and disease.

Gene Expression, the process of converting DNA information into functional gene products (primarily proteins), involves two main stages: transcription and translation. Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, catalyzed by RNA polymerase. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II transcribes protein-coding genes. The enzyme binds to a promoter region upstream of the gene, initiating RNA synthesis. The resulting RNA molecule, pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), undergoes processing: 5' capping (addition of a modified guanine), 3' polyadenylation (addition of a poly(A) tail), and splicing (removal of introns and joining of exons). Alternative splicing allows for multiple protein isoforms to be produced from a single gene, increasing protein diversity. Mature mRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm for translation. Translation occurs on ribosomes, complex molecular machines composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules act as adaptors, carrying specific amino acids and recognizing corresponding codons (three-nucleotide sequences) on the mRNA. The ribosome facilitates peptide bond formation between amino acids, synthesizing a polypeptide chain according to the genetic code. The genetic code is degenerate, with multiple codons often coding for the same amino acid. After translation, proteins may undergo post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation), crucial for their function and localization. Gene expression is tightly regulated at multiple levels: transcriptional control (by transcription factors binding to regulatory DNA sequences), RNA processing, mRNA stability, translational control, and protein degradation. Dysregulation of gene expression is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer. Techniques like RNA-Seq, Northern blotting, and qPCR quantify RNA levels, while Western blotting and proteomics analyze protein expression. These are crucial tools for understanding gene function and regulation.

Mutation and DNA Repair are critical for maintaining genomic stability and understanding the origins of genetic variation and disease. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, ranging from single-nucleotide alterations to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Point mutations include substitutions (transitions and transversions), insertions, and deletions. Frameshift mutations, resulting from insertions or deletions not divisible by three, disrupt the reading frame, often leading to nonfunctional proteins. Missense mutations cause amino acid changes, potentially altering protein function, while nonsense mutations introduce premature stop codons, resulting in truncated proteins. Splice site mutations disrupt mRNA splicing, leading to aberrant protein products. Mutations can be spontaneous, arising from errors in DNA replication or DNA repair or induced by mutagens (e.g., UV radiation, chemicals). DNA repair mechanisms are essential for correcting DNA damage and preventing mutations. Multiple pathways exist, each specialized for different types of damage. Mismatch repair (MMR) corrects errors made during replication. Base excision repair (BER) removes damaged or modified bases. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky lesions, like those caused by UV radiation. Double-strand break repair (DSBR) repairs breaks affecting both DNA strands, using either homologous recombination (HR), an error-free mechanism, or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is often error-prone. Defects in DNA repair pathways increase mutation rates and genomic instability, predisposing individuals to cancer and other diseases. Inherited defects in DNA repair genes cause syndromes like Lynch syndrome (MMR defects), xeroderma pigmentosum (NER defects), and BRCA1/2-related cancers (HR defects). Understanding mutation and repair mechanisms is fundamental for understanding disease etiology and developing targeted therapies.

Epigenetics encompasses heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations in the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications regulate gene activity and play crucial roles in development, cellular differentiation, and disease. The primary epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA-mediated regulation. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base, typically at CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is generally associated with gene silencing, often by inhibiting transcription factor binding or recruiting chromatin-remodeling proteins. Methylation patterns are established and maintained by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and can be inherited through cell division. Histone modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of histone tails. These modifications alter chromatin structure, making DNA more or less accessible to the transcriptional machinery. Histone acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), generally promotes gene expression, while histone deacetylation, catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), is associated with gene silencing. Histone methylation can have either activating or repressive effects, depending on the specific residue and the degree of methylation. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), play diverse roles in gene regulation. miRNAs are small RNAs that bind to target mRNAs, leading to translational repression or mRNA degradation. lncRNAs can interact with chromatin-modifying complexes, influencing gene expression at the transcriptional level. They can also act as scaffolds, bringing together different proteins involved in gene regulation. Epigenetic modifications are dynamic and can be influenced by environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins. Aberrant epigenetic patterns are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, where altered DNA methylation and histone modification can silence tumor suppressor genes or activate oncogenes. Imprinting disorders, like Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, are caused by epigenetic dysregulation of specific genes. Understanding epigenetic mechanisms is crucial for developing therapies targeting epigenetic modifications, such as DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors, used in cancer treatment. Techniques like ChIP-Seq, bisulfite sequencing, and RNA-Seq are essential for studying epigenetic modifications.
