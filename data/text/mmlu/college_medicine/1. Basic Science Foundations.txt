Biochemistry forms the molecular foundation of medicine. Enzyme kinetics describes enzyme-substrate interactions, characterized by the Michaelis-Menten equation, where Km represents substrate affinity and Vmax represents maximal reaction velocity. Enzyme activity is regulated by factors like allosteric modulation, covalent modification (e.g., phosphorylation), and competitive/noncompetitive inhibition. Metabolic pathways are interconnected series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Glycolysis, occurring in the cytoplasm, breaks down glucose into pyruvate, generating ATP and NADH. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactate. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The citric acid cycle generates reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2) that fuel the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, uses the energy from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthase to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (e.g., pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, amino acids) primarily in the liver, crucial during fasting. Glycogen metabolism involves glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) and breakdown (glycogenolysis), regulated by insulin and glucagon. Fatty acid metabolism involves β-oxidation, breaking down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria. Amino acid metabolism includes transamination, deamination, and the urea cycle, which eliminates nitrogenous waste. Acid-base balance is maintained by buffer systems (bicarbonate, phosphate, protein), respiratory regulation of CO2, and renal regulation of bicarbonate reabsorption and H+ secretion. Disruptions lead to acidosis (low pH) or alkalosis (high pH). Hormone signaling involves various mechanisms: steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone) bind to intracellular receptors, influencing gene transcription. Peptide hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon) bind to cell surface receptors, initiating signaling cascades often involving second messengers like cAMP or calcium. Biomolecules crucial to cellular function are proteins (structural, enzymatic, signaling), carbohydrates (energy source, structural), lipids (energy storage, membrane structure, signaling), and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA – genetic information storage and transfer).

Cell Biology encompasses the structure and function of cells, the fundamental units of life. Eukaryotic cells possess membrane-bound organelles, including the nucleus (containing DNA), mitochondria (ATP production), endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid synthesis), Golgi apparatus (protein modification and sorting), lysosomes (degradation of cellular waste), and peroxisomes (detoxification). The plasma membrane, a selectively permeable phospholipid bilayer, regulates the passage of molecules into and out of the cell. Membrane transport mechanisms include passive diffusion (movement down a concentration gradient), facilitated diffusion (carrier-mediated transport down a gradient), active transport (energy-requiring movement against a gradient), and endocytosis/exocytosis (bulk transport). Cell signaling involves communication between cells via signaling molecules (ligands) that bind to receptors. Receptor types include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and ion channel-linked receptors. Signal transduction pathways often involve cascades of protein phosphorylation and second messengers, ultimately leading to cellular responses. The cell cycle is a tightly regulated sequence of events leading to cell growth and division. It consists of interphase (G1, S, G2 phases) and mitosis (M phase). Checkpoints ensure proper progression through the cycle, preventing uncontrolled cell division. Apoptosis is programmed cell death, a crucial process for development and tissue homeostasis, distinct from necrosis (uncontrolled cell death due to injury). Basic immunology distinguishes between innate immunity (non-specific, rapid response involving barriers like skin and phagocytic cells like macrophages and neutrophils) and adaptive immunity (specific, slower response involving lymphocytes – B cells and T cells). B cells produce antibodies (humoral immunity), while T cells mediate cellular immunity (helper T cells activate other immune cells, cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presents antigens to T cells. Basic genetics covers DNA structure (double helix), replication (semi-conservative), transcription (DNA to RNA), and translation (RNA to protein). Mutations are changes in DNA sequence, which can be spontaneous or induced by mutagens, and can have various effects on protein function. Mendelian genetics describes inheritance patterns of single-gene traits.

Introductory General Physiology explores the functions of organ systems and their integration to maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment despite external changes, regulated by feedback mechanisms (negative and positive). The nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS – brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Neurons transmit information via action potentials, rapid changes in membrane potential. Synaptic transmission involves the release of neurotransmitters at synapses, which bind to receptors on postsynaptic neurons, leading to excitatory or inhibitory effects. The autonomic nervous system (part of the PNS) controls involuntary functions and is divided into the sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) divisions. Basic cardiovascular physiology focuses on the heart and blood vessels. The cardiac cycle consists of systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute (heart rate x stroke volume). Blood pressure is regulated by factors like cardiac output, peripheral resistance, and blood volume. The electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart. Basic respiratory physiology concerns gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. Ventilation is the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Gas exchange occurs across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Oxygen is transported in the blood bound to hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood as bicarbonate, dissolved CO2, and bound to hemoglobin. Respiratory rate and depth are regulated by chemoreceptors that sense changes in blood pH, CO2, and O2 levels.

Introductory General Microbiology introduces microorganisms and their interactions with humans. Bacteria are prokaryotic cells (lacking a nucleus) with diverse shapes (cocci, bacilli, spirilla) and cell wall structures (Gram-positive, Gram-negative). Bacterial growth follows a characteristic curve (lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase, death phase). Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, consisting of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat (capsid). Viral replication involves attachment, entry, replication of viral genome, assembly of new virions, and release. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms, including yeasts (single-celled) and molds (multicellular). Parasites are organisms that live in or on a host and derive benefit at the host's expense. Principles of infectious disease include the chain of infection (pathogen, reservoir, portal of exit, mode of transmission, portal of entry, susceptible host). Pathogenicity is the ability of a microorganism to cause disease. Virulence factors are traits that enhance pathogenicity. The immune system responds to infection through innate and adaptive mechanisms. Common pathogens include bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), viruses (e.g., influenza virus, HIV, herpesviruses), fungi (e.g., Candida albicans, Aspergillus), and parasites (e.g., Plasmodium (malaria), Giardia). Antimicrobial agents are drugs used to treat infections. Antibiotics target bacteria, antivirals target viruses, antifungals target fungi, and antiparasitics target parasites. Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include enzymatic inactivation of the drug, alteration of the drug target, decreased drug uptake, and increased drug efflux.

Introductory General Pharmacology explores the principles of drug action. Pharmacokinetics describes what the body does to the drug: Absorption (movement of drug from site of administration into the bloodstream), Distribution (movement of drug from bloodstream to tissues), Metabolism (biotransformation of drug, primarily in the liver by enzymes like cytochrome P450s), and Excretion (elimination of drug from the body, primarily by the kidneys). Bioavailability is the fraction of administered drug that reaches systemic circulation. Volume of distribution relates drug dose to plasma concentration. Clearance is the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time. Half-life is the time it takes for plasma drug concentration to decrease by half. Pharmacodynamics describes what the drug does to the body: Drugs primarily act by binding to receptors (proteins that mediate cellular responses). Agonists activate receptors, while antagonists block receptor activation. Dose-response curves illustrate the relationship between drug dose and effect. Efficacy is the maximal effect a drug can produce. Potency is the amount of drug needed to produce a given effect. Therapeutic index is a measure of drug safety (ratio of toxic dose to effective dose). Major drug classes include analgesics (pain relievers), antibiotics (treat bacterial infections), antihypertensives (lower blood pressure), anti-inflammatories (reduce inflammation), and many others. Mechanisms of action vary widely depending on the drug class.

Introductory General Pathology covers basic cellular and tissue responses to injury. Inflammation is a protective response to tissue injury or infection, characterized by redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function. The inflammatory process involves vascular changes (vasodilation, increased permeability), cellular events (leukocyte recruitment and activation), and chemical mediators (cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, histamine). Acute inflammation is short-term, while chronic inflammation is long-term and can lead to tissue damage. Cell injury can be reversible (cells recover) or irreversible (cells die). Causes of cell injury include hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), ischemia (reduced blood flow), toxins, infectious agents, immune reactions, and genetic factors. Necrosis is a type of cell death characterized by cell swelling, membrane rupture, and inflammation. Apoptosis, as mentioned before, is programmed cell death, and does not typically induce inflammation. Neoplasia refers to abnormal new growth of tissue (tumor). Benign tumors are non-invasive and do not metastasize (spread). Malignant tumors (cancers) are invasive and can metastasize. Carcinogenesis is the process by which normal cells transform into cancer cells, involving multiple genetic mutations.
