Introduction to Clinical Reasoning forms the cornerstone of effective medical practice. It is a cognitive process that involves gathering and analyzing patient information to arrive at a diagnosis and management plan. The process begins with a comprehensive history, meticulously eliciting the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness (HPI), past medical history, family history, social history, and review of systems. The HPI explores the patient's symptoms using the "OPQRST" framework (Onset, Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Timing) or "OLD CARTS" (Onset, Location, Duration, Character, Aggravating/Alleviating Factors, Radiation, Timing, Severity) to obtain detailed and relevant information. The past medical history includes prior illnesses, surgeries, allergies, and medications. The family history identifies potential genetic predispositions. The social history explores lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol use, diet, and occupation that may impact health. The review of systems is a systematic inquiry about symptoms in each organ system, helping to uncover potentially overlooked problems. The physical examination is a systematic assessment of the patient's body, using inspection (visual observation), palpation (feeling with hands), percussion (tapping to assess underlying structures), and auscultation (listening with a stethoscope). Vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure) provide essential objective data. The physical examination proceeds systematically, typically from head to toe, examining each organ system. After gathering data from the history and physical examination, the clinician formulates a differential diagnosis, a list of possible diagnoses that could explain the patient's presentation. The differential diagnosis is refined by considering the likelihood of each diagnosis based on the patient's demographics, risk factors, and clinical findings. The most likely diagnosis is the working diagnosis, but alternative diagnoses must be considered. Diagnostic testing (laboratory tests, imaging studies) is used judiciously to help confirm or rule out diagnoses on the differential. Tests are chosen based on their sensitivity (ability to detect disease if present), specificity (ability to rule out disease if absent), and predictive value (probability that a positive or negative test result is correct). Interpreting basic lab results requires understanding normal ranges and recognizing deviations that may indicate disease. Common lab tests include complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function tests (LFTs), and urinalysis.

Epidemiology and Biostatistics (Introductory) provide the tools to understand and interpret medical research and population health data. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of disease in populations. Key concepts include incidence (the rate of new cases of a disease), prevalence (the proportion of individuals with a disease at a given time), morbidity (the burden of illness), and mortality (the rate of death). Measures of association assess the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. Relative risk (RR) compares the risk of disease in an exposed group to the risk in an unexposed group. Odds ratio (OR) compares the odds of exposure in cases (those with the disease) to the odds of exposure in controls (those without the disease). Study designs include observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional) and experimental studies (randomized controlled trials - RCTs). Cohort studies follow a group of individuals over time to see who develops the disease. Case-control studies compare individuals with the disease (cases) to individuals without the disease (controls) to identify risk factors. Cross-sectional studies assess exposure and outcome at a single point in time. RCTs are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions, randomly assigning participants to treatment or control groups. Biostatistics provides the statistical methods used to analyze medical data. Descriptive statistics summarize data (mean, median, mode, standard deviation). Inferential statistics draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. Hypothesis testing involves testing a null hypothesis (no difference between groups) against an alternative hypothesis (a difference exists). The p-value is the probability of observing the results if the null hypothesis is true. A p-value less than a predetermined significance level (usually 0.05) is considered statistically significant, suggesting that the null hypothesis should be rejected. Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie. Sensitivity, as mentioned before, is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate). Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a person with a negative test result does not have the disease. These measures are influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population.

Medical Ethics and Professionalism underpin the practice of medicine, guiding physicians' conduct and decision-making. The four core principles of medical ethics are autonomy (respecting patients' right to make their own decisions), beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice (treating patients fairly). Informed consent is a crucial aspect of patient autonomy, requiring that patients be provided with information about their condition, treatment options, risks and benefits, and alternatives, allowing them to make informed decisions. Confidentiality protects patients' privacy, requiring that medical information be kept confidential unless there is a legal or ethical obligation to disclose it (e.g., reporting of infectious diseases, child abuse). Professionalism encompasses a set of behaviors and attitudes expected of physicians, including integrity, honesty, respect, compassion, responsibility, and accountability. The physician-patient relationship is a fiduciary relationship built on trust and mutual respect. Maintaining appropriate boundaries is essential. Conflicts of interest can arise when a physician's personal interests (financial, professional, or personal) could potentially influence their professional judgment. Managing conflicts of interest requires transparency and, in some cases, recusal from decision-making.
