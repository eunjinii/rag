Neurosurgery for board preparation demands a comprehensive grasp of intracranial pathology, spinal disorders, and cerebrovascular disease, extending beyond basic trauma management. Brain tumors require differentiating gliomas (astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas), meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and schwannomas based on location, imaging characteristics (MRI with and without contrast), and clinical presentation. Understand the principles of surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for these tumors. Spinal cord compression is a critical area, requiring rapid diagnosis and management. Know the causes of spinal cord compression (tumor, trauma, infection, herniated disc), differentiate levels based on neurological deficits, understand imaging modalities (MRI), and know the indications for surgical decompression. Cerebrovascular disease includes aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and carotid stenosis. For aneurysms, know the risk factors, locations (anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, middle cerebral artery), presentation (subarachnoid hemorrhage), and management options (surgical clipping, endovascular coiling). For AVMs, understand the presentation (hemorrhage, seizures), grading systems (Spetzler-Martin), and treatment options (surgical resection, embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery). Carotid stenosis requires knowing the indications for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) based on the degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) management includes understanding the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and surgical interventions (evacuation of hematomas, decompressive craniectomy).

Cardiothoracic Surgery requires in-depth knowledge of coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and aortic pathology, with emphasis on surgical decision-making and postoperative management. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a cornerstone. You must know the indications for CABG (left main disease, three-vessel disease, two-vessel disease with proximal LAD involvement, diabetes with multivessel disease), understand the different types of conduits (internal mammary artery, saphenous vein, radial artery) and their patency rates, and be familiar with the principles of cardiopulmonary bypass. Valve replacement and repair are crucial. Differentiate between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, understand their advantages and disadvantages, and know the indications for each. Master the surgical approaches for aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and tricuspid valve repair/replacement. Understand the management of valve-related complications, such as endocarditis and prosthetic valve dysfunction. Aortic aneurysms and dissections are high-yield topics. Know the classification of aortic aneurysms (thoracic, abdominal), risk factors, and indications for surgical repair based on size and growth rate. For aortic dissections, understand the Stanford and DeBakey classifications, presentation (acute chest pain), and management (medical management for Type B dissections, surgical repair for Type A dissections). Lung cancer surgery requires understanding the different types of lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer), staging (TNM system), and surgical options (lobectomy, pneumonectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection). Be familiar with the principles of mediastinoscopy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Congenital heart surgery, including common defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta) and their surgical correction, is also testable. Understand the principles of heart and lung transplantation, including recipient selection, immunosuppression, and management of rejection. Postoperative management of cardiothoracic surgery patients is critical, including management of complications such as bleeding, infection, arrhythmias, and respiratory failure.

General Surgery, although not explicitly listed as a subcategory in the prior table, is implicitly relevant to "professional medicine" and is often integrated into surgical specialty questions or tested in its own right within the broader MMLU context. A focused review should include: Abdominal Emergencies: Acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, bowel obstruction (small bowel and large bowel), perforated viscus, mesenteric ischemia, and diverticulitis. Differentiate based on clinical presentation, lab findings, and imaging (CT scan, abdominal X-ray). Know the appropriate surgical and non-surgical management strategies. Hernias: Inguinal, femoral, umbilical, ventral, and incisional hernias. Understand the anatomy, risk factors for incarceration and strangulation, and the principles of surgical repair (open vs. laparoscopic). Breast Surgery: Management of breast cancer, including lumpectomy, mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection, and reconstructive options. Understand the role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Endocrine Surgery: Thyroidectomy (for thyroid cancer, goiter, hyperthyroidism), parathyroidectomy (for hyperparathyroidism), and adrenalectomy (for pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, adrenal tumors). Colorectal Surgery: Management of colon and rectal cancer, including surgical resection (right hemicolectomy, left hemicolectomy, sigmoid colectomy, low anterior resection, abdominoperineal resection), and the role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Understand the management of diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel disease (surgical indications). Trauma: Basic principles of trauma management (ATLS protocols), including primary and secondary surveys, management of specific injuries (hemothorax, pneumothorax, splenic injury, liver injury), and damage control surgery. Surgical Critical Care: Management of critically ill surgical patients, including fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic monitoring, ventilator management, and nutritional support. Surgical Oncology: Principles of surgical oncology, including tumor staging, resection margins, and lymph node dissection. Vascular Surgery: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), including diagnosis (ankle-brachial index, angiography) and management (angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery). Understand the management of acute limb ischemia and chronic venous insufficiency. Minimally Invasive Surgery: Principles of laparoscopic and robotic surgery, including advantages, disadvantages, and common procedures (cholecystectomy, appendectomy, colectomy).

The "Other Specialties" section, while seemingly disparate, contains high-yield areas for a professional medicine exam, particularly in how they interact with internal medicine and surgical decision-making.

Anesthesiology preparation should focus on perioperative risk assessment and management. Master the ASA physical status classification system and its implications for anesthetic risk. Understand the different types of anesthesia (general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care) and their indications and contraindications. Know the pharmacology of commonly used anesthetic agents, including inhaled anesthetics (sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane), intravenous anesthetics (propofol, etomidate, ketamine), neuromuscular blocking agents (succinylcholine, rocuronium, vecuronium), and opioids (fentanyl, morphine, hydromorphone).
