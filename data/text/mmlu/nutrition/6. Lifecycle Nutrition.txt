Pregnancy and Lactation represent periods of significantly increased nutritional demands to support both maternal health and fetal/infant growth and development. During pregnancy, energy needs increase, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Adequate protein intake is crucial for fetal tissue growth. Essential fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important for brain and visual development. Folate is critical for preventing neural tube defects, and requirements increase significantly before and during early pregnancy. Iron needs increase dramatically due to the expansion of maternal blood volume and fetal iron storage. Calcium and vitamin D are essential for fetal skeletal development. Iodine is necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis, crucial for fetal brain development. Prenatal nutrition guidelines recommend a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy or calcium-rich alternatives. Prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements are often recommended to ensure adequate intake of key nutrients, especially folate, iron, and vitamin D. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy can have long-term impacts on offspring health, influencing the risk of chronic diseases later in life (the "developmental origins of health and disease" or DOHaD hypothesis). Gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, can have adverse effects on both maternal and fetal health. During lactation, energy needs remain elevated to support milk production. Adequate fluid intake is crucial. The nutrient composition of breast milk is influenced by maternal diet, particularly for certain vitamins (e.g., vitamin D) and fatty acids. Lactation counseling helps mothers understand the nutritional needs of breastfeeding and address any challenges they may face.

Infancy and Childhood are characterized by rapid growth and development, requiring specific nutritional considerations. Breast milk is the ideal food for infants, providing a complete source of nutrition and bioactive factors that support immune function and gut development. Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life, followed by the introduction of complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond. Infant formulas are available for infants who are not breastfed, designed to mimic the composition of breast milk as closely as possible. The introduction of complementary foods (solid foods) should begin around six months of age, gradually introducing a variety of textures and flavors. Iron-rich foods are particularly important, as iron stores from birth start to deplete around this time. Cow's milk should not be introduced as the main drink before 12 months of age. Growth charts, based on standardized data, are used to monitor infant and child growth, assessing weight-for-age, length/height-for-age, and weight-for-length/height. Failure to thrive is a condition characterized by inadequate growth, which can be caused by various factors, including inadequate nutrient intake, malabsorption, or underlying medical conditions. Childhood dietary recommendations emphasize a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy or calcium-rich alternatives. Limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium is important for preventing chronic diseases. Establishing healthy eating habits early in life is crucial for long-term health. Childhood obesity is a growing concern, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other health problems.

Adolescence is a period of rapid growth and development, marked by puberty and significant physical, hormonal, and psychological changes. Nutrient needs increase during adolescence to support these changes. Energy requirements are higher, particularly for boys due to their greater increase in lean body mass. Protein needs are also elevated to support muscle growth. Calcium and vitamin D are crucial for bone health, as peak bone mass is achieved during adolescence. Iron needs increase, particularly in girls after the onset of menstruation. Zinc is important for growth and sexual maturation. Adolescent dietary recommendations emphasize a balanced diet similar to that of adults, but with a particular focus on calcium, iron, and other nutrients essential for growth and development. Many adolescents have poor dietary habits, often consuming inadequate amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and excessive amounts of sugary drinks, fast food, and processed foods. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, are a significant concern during adolescence, often driven by body image concerns and societal pressures. Promoting healthy eating habits, body image, and physical activity is crucial during adolescence. Addressing nutritional deficiencies and promoting healthy weight management are also important.

Adulthood and Aging encompass a wide range of nutritional needs and considerations, influenced by factors such as lifestyle, health status, and age-related physiological changes. During adulthood, the focus is on maintaining health and preventing chronic diseases. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats is recommended. Limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium is important for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial, as obesity increases the risk of numerous chronic diseases. As individuals age, several physiological changes occur that can impact nutritional status. Energy needs generally decrease due to a decline in basal metabolic rate and physical activity. Protein needs may increase slightly to help maintain muscle mass and prevent sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss). Absorption of certain nutrients, such as vitamin B12, may decline with age. Sensory changes, such as decreased taste and smell, can affect food intake. Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline, become more prevalent with age. Dietary modifications may be necessary to manage these conditions. Osteoporosis, characterized by decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures, is a major concern in older adults, particularly women. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, along with weight-bearing exercise, are important for maintaining bone health. Sarcopenia can lead to decreased strength, mobility, and functional independence. Adequate protein intake and resistance exercise are important for preventing and managing sarcopenia. Cognitive decline, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease, is a growing concern in aging populations. Some evidence suggests that dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. Nutritional assessment in older adults should consider factors such as functional status, cognitive function, medication use, and social support, in addition to dietary intake and biochemical markers.
