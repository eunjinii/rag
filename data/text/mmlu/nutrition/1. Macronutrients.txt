Carbohydrates, a primary source of energy for the body, are broadly classified into simple and complex carbohydrates based on their chemical structure. Simple carbohydrates include monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, maltose). Glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for cells, while fructose and galactose are converted to glucose in the liver. Complex carbohydrates include oligosaccharides (raffinose, stachyose) and polysaccharides (starch, glycogen, dietary fiber). Starch, the storage form of glucose in plants, is a major source of dietary carbohydrates. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in animals, primarily found in the liver and muscles. Dietary fiber, a type of complex carbohydrate that is not digested by human enzymes, plays important roles in gut health. It is classified as soluble fiber (which dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance) and insoluble fiber (which does not dissolve in water). Soluble fiber can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and promotes regularity. The glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) are measures of how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels. High-GI foods are rapidly digested and absorbed, causing a sharp rise in blood glucose, while low-GI foods are digested and absorbed more slowly, resulting in a more gradual rise in blood glucose. The GL takes into account both the GI and the amount of carbohydrate in a serving of food. Carbohydrate counting is a meal planning technique used by individuals with diabetes to manage their blood glucose levels. It involves tracking the grams of carbohydrate consumed at each meal and adjusting insulin doses accordingly. Dietary fiber analysis is used to determine the fiber content of foods. Carbohydrates play crucial roles in energy metabolism, providing fuel for the brain, muscles, and other tissues. Adequate carbohydrate intake is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels and preventing hypoglycemia. Excessive carbohydrate intake, particularly from refined sugars and processed foods, can contribute to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems.

Proteins, essential macronutrients composed of amino acids, serve numerous structural and functional roles in the body. They are the building blocks of tissues, enzymes, hormones, antibodies, and other essential molecules. Amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains, which fold into complex three-dimensional structures to form functional proteins. There are 20 standard amino acids, of which nine are considered essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) because they cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. The remaining 11 amino acids are considered non-essential because they can be synthesized from other amino acids or precursors. Protein quality refers to the amino acid composition and digestibility of a protein source. Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids in adequate proportions, while incomplete proteins are lacking in one or more essential amino acids. Animal proteins are generally complete proteins, while plant proteins are often incomplete, with the exception of soy and quinoa. Complementary proteins are two or more incomplete protein sources that, when combined, provide all the essential amino acids. Nitrogen balance is a measure of protein status, reflecting the difference between nitrogen intake (from dietary protein) and nitrogen excretion (primarily in urine). Positive nitrogen balance occurs when nitrogen intake exceeds nitrogen excretion, indicating net protein synthesis (e.g., during growth, pregnancy, or recovery from illness). Negative nitrogen balance occurs when nitrogen excretion exceeds nitrogen intake, indicating net protein breakdown (e.g., during starvation, severe illness, or injury). Protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) is a method for evaluating protein quality, taking into account both the amino acid composition and the digestibility of the protein. Amino acid analysis is used to determine the amino acid composition of proteins. Proteins play crucial roles in muscle growth and repair, immune function, enzyme catalysis, hormone signaling, and many other physiological processes. Adequate protein intake is essential for maintaining health and preventing protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), which can manifest as kwashiorkor (characterized by edema) or marasmus (characterized by severe wasting). Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, can be mitigated by adequate protein intake and resistance exercise. Individuals with inborn errors of metabolism, such as phenylketonuria (PKU), may require specialized diets with restricted amounts of certain amino acids.

Lipids (Fats), a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, serve as a concentrated source of energy, structural components of cell membranes, and precursors for hormones and other signaling molecules. They are classified into several categories, including triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols. Triglycerides, the most abundant type of dietary fat, consist of a glycerol molecule bound to three fatty acids. Fatty acids are classified as saturated, unsaturated (monounsaturated or polyunsaturated), or trans, based on the presence and configuration of double bonds between carbon atoms. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds and are generally solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds and are generally liquid at room temperature. Monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond, while polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds. Trans fats, formed during the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats, have a trans configuration around the double bond and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid), cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. They are precursors for longer-chain fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which play important roles in inflammation, brain function, and cardiovascular health. Phospholipids are similar to triglycerides but contain a phosphate group and a nitrogen-containing base in place of one fatty acid. They are major components of cell membranes. Sterols, such as cholesterol, have a multi-ring structure. Cholesterol is a component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. Fatty acid analysis is used to determine the fatty acid composition of lipids. Lipid profiles, which measure blood levels of cholesterol (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol) and triglycerides, are used to assess cardiovascular risk. Lipoprotein analysis measures the levels of different types of lipoproteins, which transport lipids in the blood. Lipids play crucial roles in energy storage, cell signaling, hormone production, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Dietary fat intake should be moderate, with a focus on unsaturated fats and limited intake of saturated and trans fats. Excessive fat intake, particularly of saturated and trans fats, can contribute to weight gain, cardiovascular disease, and other health problems. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, often associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
