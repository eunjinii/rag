Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is the evidence-based application of the nutrition care process to treat or manage disease. It involves a comprehensive assessment of a patient's nutritional status, the development of an individualized nutrition care plan, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Registered dietitians (RDs) or registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) are the healthcare professionals primarily responsible for providing MNT. The nutrition care process, a systematic approach to providing nutrition care, consists of four steps: assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring/evaluation . Nutrition assessment involves collecting and interpreting data from various sources, including medical history, physical examination, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI, etc.), biochemical data (laboratory tests), and dietary intake. Nutrition diagnosis involves identifying and labeling specific nutrition problems, using standardized terminology (e.g., "inadequate energy intake," "excessive sodium intake," "altered GI function"). Nutrition intervention involves developing and implementing a plan to address the identified nutrition problems. This may include dietary modifications, nutrition education, counseling, and coordination of care with other healthcare providers. Monitoring and evaluation involve tracking the patient's progress, assessing the effectiveness of the intervention, and making adjustments as needed. MNT is used to manage a wide range of conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, and eating disorders. For diabetes, MNT focuses on carbohydrate counting, glycemic control, and weight management. For cardiovascular disease, MNT emphasizes reducing saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, and increasing fiber intake. For kidney disease, MNT involves managing protein, phosphorus, potassium, and fluid intake, depending on the stage of the disease. For cancer, MNT aims to maintain nutritional status during treatment, manage side effects, and support recovery. For gastrointestinal disorders, MNT may involve dietary modifications to manage symptoms, such as a low-FODMAP diet for irritable bowel syndrome or a gluten-free diet for celiac disease. MNT protocols and guidelines are developed based on scientific evidence and best practices. RDs/RDNs work collaboratively with other healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, to provide comprehensive patient care.

Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition are specialized forms of nutrition support used when oral intake is inadequate or contraindicated. Enteral nutrition (EN) involves delivering nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract via a tube. This is the preferred route of nutrition support when the gut is functional. Different types of feeding tubes are used, depending on the patient's needs and the anticipated duration of EN. Nasogastric tubes (NG tubes) are inserted through the nose and into the stomach. Nasoduodenal and nasojejunal tubes are inserted through the nose and into the duodenum or jejunum, respectively. Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are placed directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Jejunostomy tubes (J-tubes) are placed directly into the jejunum. Enteral feeding formulas are available in a variety of compositions, designed to meet different nutrient needs. Standard formulas provide a balanced mix of macronutrients and micronutrients. Elemental formulas contain pre-digested nutrients (amino acids, simple sugars, medium-chain triglycerides) for patients with impaired digestion or absorption. Disease-specific formulas are tailored for specific conditions, such as renal failure or diabetes. EN is used for a wide range of conditions, including critical illness, neurological disorders that impair swallowing, gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer. Monitoring of EN involves assessing tolerance (e.g., checking for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte balance, and monitoring for complications, such as aspiration pneumonia or tube displacement. Parenteral nutrition (PN) involves delivering nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. PN is used when the gut is not functional or when EN is contraindicated. PN solutions contain a mixture of dextrose (glucose), amino acids, lipids, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements. PN can be administered through a central venous catheter (central PN) or a peripheral intravenous catheter (peripheral PN). Central PN is typically used for long-term PN and can provide higher concentrations of nutrients. Peripheral PN is used for short-term PN and has a lower risk of complications but provides a limited amount of nutrients. PN is used for conditions such as short bowel syndrome, severe inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal obstruction, and critical illness when EN is not feasible. Monitoring of PN involves careful assessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, blood glucose levels, liver function, and other metabolic parameters. Complications of PN can include catheter-related infections, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and liver dysfunction. Both EN and PN require careful monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including physicians, dietitians, pharmacists, and nurses. The choice between EN and PN, and the specific type of formula or solution, depends on the patient's individual needs and clinical condition.
