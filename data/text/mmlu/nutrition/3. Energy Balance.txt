Energy Intake represents the caloric content derived from the consumption of macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins, and fats – and, to a lesser extent, alcohol. Carbohydrates and proteins provide approximately 4 kcal/gram, while fats provide about 9 kcal/gram, and alcohol provides 7 kcal/gram. These values are determined using bomb calorimetry, which measures the heat released when a food is completely combusted. However, the Atwater factors, which are commonly used to calculate the energy content of foods, account for the digestibility and metabolic utilization of macronutrients, resulting in slightly different values than those obtained from bomb calorimetry. Dietary sources of energy vary widely, and the composition of the diet (i.e., the relative proportions of macronutrients) influences overall energy intake. Food intake is regulated by a complex interplay of physiological, psychological, and environmental factors. Hunger, the physiological drive to eat, is influenced by signals from the gastrointestinal tract, hormones like ghrelin (which stimulates hunger) and leptin (which signals satiety), and nutrient levels in the blood. Appetite, the desire to eat, is influenced by sensory factors (taste, smell, appearance of food), emotional state, and learned behaviors. Satiety, the feeling of fullness that inhibits further eating, is influenced by gastric distension, hormonal signals (e.g., cholecystokinin), and the macronutrient composition of the meal. Accurate assessment of energy intake is challenging. Dietary assessment methods include food records (where individuals record everything they eat and drink over a specified period), 24-hour recalls (where individuals recall everything they ate and drank in the previous 24 hours), and food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) (where individuals report the frequency with which they consume specific foods over a defined period). Each method has limitations; food records are considered the most accurate but are prone to underreporting and require significant participant burden. 24-hour recalls are less burdensome but rely on memory, and FFQs are useful for assessing long-term dietary patterns but are less precise for quantifying energy intake. Indirect calorimetry, a technique that measures oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, can be used to estimate energy expenditure, which, under conditions of energy balance, should equal energy intake.

Energy Expenditure comprises the total amount of energy used by the body over a given period. It can be divided into several components: basal metabolic rate (BMR), the thermic effect of food (TEF), physical activity, and adaptive thermogenesis. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the energy required to maintain basic physiological functions at rest in a thermoneutral environment. It accounts for the largest proportion of total energy expenditure (typically 60-75%). BMR is influenced by factors such as age (decreases with age), sex (higher in males), body composition (higher in individuals with more lean mass), and genetics. The thermic effect of food (TEF), also known as diet-induced thermogenesis, is the energy required to digest, absorb, and process nutrients. It accounts for approximately 10% of total energy expenditure and varies slightly depending on the macronutrient composition of the meal (protein has a higher TEF than carbohydrates or fats). Physical activity is the most variable component of energy expenditure, ranging from minimal in sedentary individuals to very high in athletes. It includes both volitional exercise and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which encompasses all other activities of daily living. Adaptive thermogenesis refers to changes in energy expenditure in response to environmental stressors, such as cold exposure or overfeeding. It is a relatively small component of total energy expenditure in most individuals. Energy expenditure can be measured using several methods. Indirect calorimetry, as mentioned above, is the gold standard for measuring resting energy expenditure (REE), which is often used as a proxy for BMR. Doubly labeled water (DLW) is a technique used to measure total energy expenditure (TEE) over a period of days or weeks in free-living individuals. It involves administering isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and measuring their elimination rates in urine. Accelerometry and activity monitors can be used to estimate energy expenditure from physical activity. These devices measure movement and use algorithms to estimate energy expenditure. Understanding the components of energy expenditure and the factors that influence them is crucial for weight management, assessing energy needs in different populations, and understanding metabolic adaptations to various conditions.
