Vitamins, essential organic compounds required in small amounts for diverse metabolic processes, are categorized into water-soluble and fat-soluble groups. Water-soluble vitamins include the B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12) and vitamin C. These vitamins generally act as coenzymes in various enzymatic reactions. Thiamin (B1) plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism, and its deficiency leads to beriberi. Riboflavin (B2) is a component of FAD and FMN, involved in redox reactions, with deficiency causing ariboflavinosis. Niacin (B3), part of NAD and NADP, is also involved in redox reactions; deficiency results in pellagra. Pantothenic acid (B5) is a component of coenzyme A, essential for fatty acid metabolism. Biotin is involved in carboxylation reactions. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine) is crucial for amino acid metabolism, and deficiency can cause neurological symptoms and anemia. Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, particularly important during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is involved in DNA synthesis and neurological function; deficiency leads to pernicious anemia and neurological disorders. Absorption of B12 requires intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by the stomach. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an antioxidant and cofactor for collagen synthesis; deficiency causes scurvy. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are absorbed with dietary fat and stored in the liver and adipose tissue. Vitamin A (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid) is essential for vision, immune function, and cell differentiation. Deficiency causes night blindness and xerophthalmia. Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) is crucial for calcium absorption and bone health. Deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and can also be obtained from dietary sources. Vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from damage. Deficiency is rare but can cause neurological problems. Vitamin K (phylloquinone and menaquinones) is essential for blood clotting, acting as a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues in clotting factors. Deficiency can lead to bleeding disorders. Assessment of vitamin status involves measuring blood levels of the vitamin or its metabolites, as well as functional assays that assess the activity of vitamin-dependent enzymes.

Minerals, inorganic elements essential for various physiological functions, are classified as major minerals (required in larger amounts) and trace minerals (required in smaller amounts). Major minerals include calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfur. Calcium is crucial for bone health, muscle contraction, nerve function, and blood clotting. Phosphorus is also important for bone health and is a component of ATP and nucleic acids. Potassium is a major intracellular cation, important for nerve function and fluid balance. Sodium is a major extracellular cation, important for fluid balance and nerve function. Chloride is a major extracellular anion, important for fluid balance and stomach acid production. Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions and is important for muscle and nerve function, as well as bone health. Sulfur is a component of some amino acids and vitamins. Trace minerals include iron, zinc, copper, selenium, iodine, fluoride, chromium, manganese, and molybdenum. Iron is a component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, essential for oxygen transport. Zinc is involved in numerous enzymatic reactions and is important for immune function, wound healing, and growth. Copper is a cofactor for several enzymes, including those involved in iron metabolism and antioxidant defense. Selenium is a component of selenoproteins, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and prevents dental caries. Chromium may enhance insulin action. Manganese is a cofactor for enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Molybdenum is a cofactor for enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism. Mineral status assessment involves measuring blood levels, bone density (for calcium), and other tissue levels. Deficiencies or excesses of minerals can lead to a variety of health problems. For example, iron deficiency causes anemia, iodine deficiency causes goiter, and calcium deficiency contributes to osteoporosis. Dietary intake, bioavailability, and interactions with other nutrients can all influence mineral status.
