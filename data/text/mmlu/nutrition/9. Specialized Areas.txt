Sports Nutrition focuses on the application of nutritional principles to enhance athletic performance, recovery, and overall health. It involves tailoring dietary strategies to meet the specific energy and nutrient needs of athletes, considering the type, intensity, and duration of exercise. Macronutrient requirements are often adjusted based on training demands. Carbohydrate intake is crucial for providing energy for muscle glycogen stores, particularly for endurance activities. Timing of carbohydrate intake before, during, and after exercise is important for optimizing performance and recovery. Protein needs are generally higher in athletes than in sedentary individuals, to support muscle repair and growth. Recommendations vary depending on the type of training, with strength-training athletes typically requiring more protein than endurance athletes. Fat intake is important for providing energy, particularly for prolonged, lower-intensity exercise, and for supporting hormone production. Micronutrient needs may also be increased in athletes due to increased metabolic demands and potential losses through sweat. Iron, calcium, vitamin D, and antioxidants are of particular concern. Hydration is critical for athletic performance, as dehydration can impair performance and increase the risk of heat illness. Fluid intake should be individualized based on sweat rate, environmental conditions, and exercise duration. Electrolyte replacement may be necessary during prolonged or intense exercise, particularly in hot and humid environments. Ergogenic aids are substances or practices that are purported to enhance athletic performance. These include supplements, such as creatine, caffeine, and beta-alanine, as well as practices like carbohydrate loading. The effectiveness and safety of ergogenic aids vary widely, and athletes should be cautious about their use, considering potential side effects and regulations. Dietary assessment for athletes involves assessing usual dietary intake, as well as pre-, during, and post-exercise nutrition. Performance testing, such as VO2max testing and body composition analysis, can be used to assess training adaptations and inform nutritional strategies. Relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) is a syndrome characterized by low energy availability, which can lead to impaired physiological function, including menstrual dysfunction, decreased bone mineral density, and impaired immune function. Sports nutritionists work with athletes to develop individualized nutrition plans, considering their training goals, dietary preferences, and any medical conditions.

Food Science and Technology encompasses the study of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of food, from its production to its consumption. It involves various disciplines, including chemistry, microbiology, engineering, and nutrition. Food processing involves transforming raw agricultural products into edible food products. This can include techniques such as heating, cooling, drying, fermentation, and packaging. Food preservation aims to extend the shelf life of food and prevent spoilage by inhibiting microbial growth and enzymatic activity. Common preservation methods include canning, freezing, drying, and irradiation. Food safety is a critical aspect of food science and technology, focusing on preventing foodborne illness. This involves controlling microbial contamination, chemical hazards, and physical hazards throughout the food supply chain. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic approach to identifying and controlling food safety hazards. Food quality encompasses various attributes, including sensory properties (taste, smell, texture, appearance), nutritional value, and safety. Sensory evaluation involves using human senses to assess food quality. Food analysis involves using various analytical techniques to determine the composition and properties of food. Food microbiology studies the microorganisms that are present in food, including both beneficial microorganisms (e.g., those used in fermentation) and spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Food chemistry focuses on the chemical composition of food and the chemical reactions that occur during processing and storage. Food engineering involves applying engineering principles to food processing and packaging. The development of new food products is an important aspect of food science and technology, involving creating new formulations, processing methods, and packaging. This often involves considering consumer preferences, nutritional trends, and sustainability concerns. Foodborne illness, caused by consuming contaminated food, is a major public health concern. Common foodborne pathogens include Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter. Food allergies and food intolerances are adverse reactions to specific foods or food components. Food allergies involve an immune response, while food intolerances do not. Common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Food science and technology play a crucial role in ensuring a safe, nutritious, and sustainable food supply.

Nutrigenomics explores the intricate interplay between nutrients, dietary components, and the genome, investigating how these interactions influence gene expression, cellular processes, and ultimately, health outcomes. It encompasses both nutrigenetics, which examines how individual genetic variations affect responses to nutrients, and nutrigenomics (in the narrower sense), which focuses on how nutrients and bioactive food compounds modulate gene expression. Key techniques involve "-omics" technologies. Genomics studies the entire genome, including variations like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Transcriptomics examines the complete set of RNA transcripts (the transcriptome), revealing which genes are actively being expressed. Proteomics analyzes the complete set of proteins (the proteome), providing insights into cellular function. Metabolomics studies the complete set of small-molecule metabolites, reflecting metabolic pathways and cellular status. These techniques, combined with sophisticated bioinformatics and statistical analyses, allow researchers to identify gene-nutrient interactions and their downstream effects. For instance, SNPs in genes involved in nutrient metabolism can influence how individuals process and utilize specific nutrients, leading to variations in nutrient requirements or susceptibility to diet-related diseases. Examples include variations in the MTHFR gene, which affects folate metabolism, and variations in genes involved in lipid metabolism, which can influence responses to dietary fats. Nutrients and bioactive food compounds can directly or indirectly influence gene expression through various mechanisms. They can act as ligands for transcription factors, bind to receptors that activate signaling pathways, or alter epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modification). For example, omega-3 fatty acids can activate PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), transcription factors that regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Sulforaphane, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, can activate Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant and detoxification genes. Resveratrol, found in grapes and red wine, can influence sirtuins, proteins involved in cellular aging and metabolism. The ultimate goal of nutrigenomics is to develop personalized nutrition recommendations based on an individual's genetic makeup, optimizing health and preventing disease. This approach holds promise for tailoring dietary interventions to prevent or manage chronic conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, the field is still relatively young, and many gene-nutrient interactions are complex and not yet fully understood. Ethical considerations, such as genetic privacy and the potential for genetic discrimination, also need to be addressed.
