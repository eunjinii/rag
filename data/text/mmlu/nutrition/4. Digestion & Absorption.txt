Gastrointestinal Physiology encompasses the structure and function of the digestive system, a complex series of organs responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. The process begins in the mouth, where mechanical digestion (chewing) and chemical digestion (salivary amylase acting on carbohydrates) initiate the breakdown of food. The esophagus transports food to the stomach via peristalsis, rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle. The stomach, a highly acidic environment (due to hydrochloric acid secreted by parietal cells), continues both mechanical and chemical digestion. Pepsin, secreted by chief cells as pepsinogen, initiates protein digestion. The stomach also produces intrinsic factor, essential for vitamin B12 absorption. The small intestine, the primary site of nutrient absorption, is divided into three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum receives chyme (partially digested food) from the stomach, along with bile from the liver and gallbladder (for fat emulsification) and pancreatic enzymes (for carbohydrate, protein, and fat digestion). The pancreas secretes amylase, proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidases), and lipases. The jejunum and ileum are lined with villi and microvilli, which vastly increase the surface area for absorption. The large intestine primarily absorbs water and electrolytes and houses the gut microbiota, a complex community of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. The gut microbiota plays crucial roles in nutrient metabolism, vitamin synthesis (e.g., vitamin K), immune function, and protection against pathogens. Gut hormones, such as gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), regulate various aspects of digestion, including gastric emptying, enzyme secretion, and appetite. Diagnostic techniques used to assess gastrointestinal function include endoscopy (visualization of the upper GI tract), colonoscopy (visualization of the lower GI tract), motility studies (measuring the contractions of the GI tract), stool analysis (assessing for pathogens, fat content, and other markers), and breath tests (e.g., for lactose intolerance or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth).

Nutrient Absorption, the process by which nutrients from digested food are taken up into the bloodstream, occurs primarily in the small intestine. Different nutrients are absorbed via different mechanisms. Passive diffusion requires no energy and occurs when the concentration of a nutrient is higher in the intestinal lumen than in the enterocytes (intestinal cells). Small, lipid-soluble molecules, such as some vitamins, can be absorbed via passive diffusion. Facilitated diffusion also requires no energy but involves a carrier protein that binds to the nutrient and facilitates its transport across the cell membrane. Fructose absorption often occurs via facilitated diffusion. Active transport requires energy (ATP) and a carrier protein and can transport nutrients against a concentration gradient. Glucose and amino acids are absorbed via active transport, often coupled to sodium transport (sodium-glucose cotransporters, SGLTs). Fats are digested into fatty acids and monoglycerides, which are emulsified by bile salts to form micelles. Micelles diffuse into enterocytes, where fatty acids and monoglycerides are re-esterified into triglycerides. Triglycerides, along with cholesterol and phospholipids, are packaged into chylomicrons, which are transported into the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream. Water-soluble vitamins are generally absorbed via passive or facilitated diffusion, while fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fats. Minerals are absorbed via various mechanisms, including active transport and passive diffusion. Iron absorption is tightly regulated, with heme iron (from animal sources) being more readily absorbed than non-heme iron (from plant sources). Calcium absorption is enhanced by vitamin D. Several factors can influence nutrient absorption. Dietary factors, such as the presence of fiber, phytates, and oxalates, can inhibit the absorption of certain minerals. Gut health, including the integrity of the intestinal lining and the composition of the gut microbiota, plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption. Medications can also affect nutrient absorption. Malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, and short bowel syndrome, result from impaired nutrient absorption and can lead to various nutrient deficiencies. Diagnostic tests for malabsorption include the D-xylose test (assessing carbohydrate absorption) and fecal fat tests (assessing fat absorption).
