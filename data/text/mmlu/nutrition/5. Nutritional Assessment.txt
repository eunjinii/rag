Anthropometry, the measurement of body size and composition, is a fundamental component of nutritional assessment. It provides valuable information about overall nutritional status, growth and development in children, and risk for chronic diseases. Height and weight are basic anthropometric measurements, used to calculate body mass index (BMI), a widely used indicator of weight status. BMI is calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters squared). BMI categories are used to classify individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. However, BMI does not distinguish between fat mass and lean mass, and it may not be accurate for all populations (e.g., athletes with high muscle mass). Skinfold thickness measurements, using calipers at specific sites on the body (e.g., triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac), provide an estimate of subcutaneous fat. Equations are used to estimate body density from skinfold measurements, and body fat percentage can then be calculated using formulas like the Siri equation. Waist circumference, measured at the midpoint between the lower rib and the iliac crest, is an indicator of abdominal fat, which is strongly associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is another measure of body fat distribution. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a non-invasive technique that estimates body composition by measuring the resistance of the body to a weak electrical current. Fat-free mass (primarily muscle and water) conducts electricity more readily than fat mass. BIA devices range from simple handheld devices to more sophisticated multi-frequency analyzers. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density and can also be used to assess body composition (fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral content). Standardized measurement techniques are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of anthropometric measurements. Growth charts, based on reference data from large populations, are used to assess growth and development in children and adolescents. These charts plot height-for-age, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age percentiles. Anthropometric measurements are used to identify individuals at risk for malnutrition (both undernutrition and overnutrition), monitor response to nutritional interventions, and assess risk for chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Biochemical Assessment involves measuring nutrient levels, their metabolites, or related biomarkers in blood, urine, or other tissues to assess nutritional status and identify deficiencies or excesses. Laboratory assays are used to measure a wide range of nutrients and biomarkers. Serum albumin, a protein synthesized in the liver, is often used as an indicator of protein status, although it is influenced by factors other than nutrition, such as inflammation and liver disease. Prealbumin (transthyretin) has a shorter half-life than albumin and is considered a more sensitive indicator of recent changes in protein status. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are used to assess iron status and identify anemia. Ferritin, a protein that stores iron, is a sensitive indicator of iron deficiency. Transferrin saturation, the percentage of transferrin (an iron transport protein) that is bound to iron, is also used to assess iron status. Vitamin B12 and folate levels are measured to assess status of these vitamins, often in the context of anemia. Vitamin D status is assessed by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Calcium status is more difficult to assess biochemically, as serum calcium levels are tightly regulated. Bone mineral density (measured by DXA) is a better indicator of long-term calcium status. Electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate) are measured to assess fluid and electrolyte balance. Liver function tests (LFTs), such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), can provide information about liver health, which can be affected by malnutrition. Renal function tests, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, can assess kidney function, which is important for interpreting certain nutrient levels. Functional assays assess the activity of enzymes or physiological processes that depend on specific nutrients. For example, erythrocyte transketolase activity is used to assess thiamin status. Interpretation of biochemical data requires considering the individual's clinical context, including medical history, medications, and other factors that may influence nutrient levels. Reference ranges for laboratory values vary depending on the laboratory and the population. Biochemical assessment is used to diagnose nutrient deficiencies, monitor response to nutritional interventions, and identify individuals at risk for nutrient-related health problems.

Clinical Assessment involves a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's health status, focusing on identifying signs and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies or excesses, and assessing overall nutritional risk. It complements anthropometric and biochemical assessments. Medical history taking is a crucial component, gathering information about past and present medical conditions, medications, allergies, surgeries, and family history of nutrition-related diseases. The clinician inquires about symptoms that may be related to nutritional status, such as fatigue, weakness, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, gastrointestinal problems, and skin or hair changes. Physical examination involves a systematic assessment of the body, looking for signs of malnutrition or nutrient deficiencies. This includes assessing general appearance, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature), skin (for pallor, lesions, edema), hair (for thinning, loss, changes in texture), nails (for changes in shape or color), eyes (for signs of vitamin A deficiency), mouth (for signs of B vitamin deficiencies), and musculoskeletal system (for muscle wasting). Specific signs of nutrient deficiencies include: pallor (iron deficiency anemia), koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, iron deficiency), glossitis (inflammation of the tongue, B vitamin deficiencies), cheilosis (cracking at the corners of the mouth, riboflavin deficiency), night blindness (vitamin A deficiency), Bitot's spots (foamy patches on the conjunctiva, vitamin A deficiency), edema (protein deficiency), and muscle wasting (protein-energy malnutrition). The clinician also assesses for signs of nutrient excesses, such as obesity (excess energy intake) or hypervitaminosis A (excess vitamin A intake). Functional assessment, evaluating an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living, can provide insights into nutritional status and overall health. Cognitive assessment may also be relevant, as nutrient deficiencies can affect cognitive function. The clinical assessment helps to identify individuals who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition, guide further investigations (e.g., biochemical tests), and inform the development of a nutrition care plan. It is an essential part of a comprehensive nutritional assessment.

Dietary Assessment involves evaluating an individual's usual food and beverage intake to determine the adequacy of their diet and identify potential nutritional problems. Various methods are used, each with its strengths and limitations. 24-hour recalls involve asking the individual to recall everything they ate and drank in the previous 24 hours. This method is relatively quick and inexpensive but relies on memory and may not reflect usual intake. Multiple 24-hour recalls on non-consecutive days can provide a more accurate estimate of usual intake. Food records (also called food diaries) involve asking the individual to record everything they eat and drink over a specified period (typically 3-7 days). This method is considered more accurate than 24-hour recalls but requires more effort from the participant and may alter eating behavior. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) ask individuals to report how often they consume specific foods or food groups over a defined period (e.g., the past month or year). FFQs are useful for assessing long-term dietary patterns but are less precise for quantifying nutrient intake. Diet history combines elements of 24-hour recalls, food records, and FFQs to obtain a comprehensive picture of an individual's usual dietary intake. It often involves an interview with a trained dietitian. Dietary analysis software is used to analyze dietary data from 24-hour recalls, food records, or FFQs, calculating nutrient intake and comparing it to dietary reference intakes (DRIs). Nutrient databases, such as the USDA National Nutrient Database, provide information on the nutrient content of foods. Validated questionnaires are questionnaires that have been tested for their accuracy and reliability in assessing dietary intake. Factors to consider when choosing a dietary assessment method include the purpose of the assessment, the population being studied, the resources available, and the desired level of accuracy. Dietary assessment is used to evaluate dietary adequacy, identify dietary risk factors for disease, plan nutritional interventions, and monitor the effectiveness of interventions. It is an essential component of nutritional assessment and research. The accuracy of all of these methods are highly dependent on the individual remembering food intake.
