Viral genomes exhibit remarkable diversity, existing as DNA or RNA, single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), linear or circular, and in some cases, segmented. DNA viruses, like herpesviruses and adenoviruses, typically replicate their genomes in the host cell nucleus (with poxviruses being a notable exception, replicating in the cytoplasm) using either host or virally-encoded DNA polymerases. These DNA polymerases generally have proofreading capabilities, leading to lower mutation rates compared to RNA viruses. RNA viruses, such as influenza viruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses, replicate their genomes using RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), which lack proofreading activity, resulting in significantly higher mutation rates. This high mutation rate drives rapid viral evolution, contributing to antigenic variation and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Retroviruses, like HIV, are unique in that they use reverse transcriptase (RT), an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, to convert their ssRNA genome into dsDNA, which then integrates into the host cell's genome. Segmented genomes, found in influenza viruses and rotaviruses, allow for genetic reassortment, a process where different viral strains co-infecting the same cell can exchange genome segments, leading to the rapid emergence of new viral strains with potentially altered virulence or host range.

Viral capsids, the protein shells that enclose the viral genome, are primarily classified into three structural forms: icosahedral, helical, and complex. Icosahedral capsids, common among animal viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, herpesviruses, picornaviruses), are highly symmetrical structures composed of repeating protein subunits (capsomeres) arranged in a quasi-spherical shape. The icosahedral symmetry provides stability and efficient packaging of the viral genome. Helical capsids, often found in plant viruses and some animal viruses (e.g., paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses), consist of protein subunits arranged in a helical array around the viral genome, forming a rod-shaped structure. Complex capsids, as seen in poxviruses and some bacteriophages, don't conform to simple icosahedral or helical symmetry and have more intricate structures with additional proteins and layers. Capsid proteins play crucial roles beyond genome protection. They are involved in viral attachment to host cell receptors, facilitating entry, and are also critical for the assembly of new virions. Some capsid proteins have enzymatic activities or can interact with host cell factors to modulate cellular processes. Targeting capsid proteins with antiviral drugs is a promising strategy, as disrupting capsid assembly or function can effectively inhibit viral replication.

Viral envelopes, present in many animal viruses (e.g., influenza viruses, herpesviruses, HIV), are lipid bilayers derived from host cell membranes (plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, Golgi membrane, or endoplasmic reticulum membrane) during the viral budding process. Embedded within the envelope are virally encoded glycoproteins, which project outward from the surface. These envelope glycoproteins are crucial for viral attachment to specific host cell receptors, initiating infection. They also mediate membrane fusion, allowing the viral nucleocapsid (genome plus capsid) to enter the cytoplasm. The presence of an envelope generally makes viruses more susceptible to inactivation by detergents, solvents, and heat compared to non-enveloped viruses. The lipid composition of the envelope reflects that of the host cell membrane from which it was derived. Envelope glycoproteins are often major targets of neutralizing antibodies, making them important for vaccine development. However, the high mutation rate of many enveloped RNA viruses can lead to antigenic variation in these glycoproteins, allowing the virus to evade antibody responses.

The viral replication cycle, a tightly orchestrated series of events, can be broadly divided into the following stages: attachment, entry, uncoating, genome replication, protein synthesis, assembly, and release. Attachment involves specific binding of viral surface proteins (capsid proteins in non-enveloped viruses, envelope glycoproteins in enveloped viruses) to receptors on the host cell surface. These receptors can be proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids. The specificity of this interaction determines viral tropism â€“ the range of cell types and host species a virus can infect. Entry mechanisms vary depending on the virus. Enveloped viruses often enter via receptor-mediated endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Non-enveloped viruses typically enter via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Uncoating refers to the release of the viral genome from the capsid, making it accessible for replication and gene expression. This process can occur in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, depending on the virus. Genome replication and protein synthesis utilize host cell machinery and, in some cases, virally encoded enzymes (e.g., polymerases, proteases). The specific mechanisms vary widely depending on the type of viral genome (DNA, RNA, ssRNA, dsRNA). RNA viruses must encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate their genomes, as host cells lack this enzyme. Retroviruses use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA genome into DNA. Assembly involves the packaging of newly synthesized viral genomes and proteins into new virions. This process can occur in the cytoplasm, nucleus, or at specific cellular membranes. Release of progeny virions can occur through cell lysis (common for non-enveloped viruses) or budding (for enveloped viruses). Budding involves the wrapping of the nucleocapsid in a portion of the host cell membrane, acquiring the viral envelope.

Viral tropism, the ability of a virus to infect specific cell types or tissues, is a critical determinant of viral pathogenesis. Tropism is primarily determined by the presence of specific receptors on the host cell surface that are recognized by viral attachment proteins. For example, HIV-1 tropism for CD4+ T cells and macrophages is dictated by its envelope glycoprotein (gp120) binding to the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). However, receptor expression is not the only factor. Intracellular factors within the host cell, such as transcription factors and enzymes required for viral replication, can also influence tropism. The host immune response can also restrict viral tropism. Interferons, for example, induce an antiviral state in cells, making them less susceptible to infection. Anatomical barriers and the route of viral entry also play a role. Some viruses exhibit narrow tropism, infecting only a limited number of cell types (e.g., rhinoviruses primarily infect cells of the upper respiratory tract), while others have broad tropism, infecting many different cell types (e.g., cytomegalovirus). Understanding viral tropism is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases and for developing targeted antiviral therapies. Changes in viral tropism, due to mutations in viral attachment proteins, can lead to the emergence of new viral diseases or altered disease severity.
