Antiviral drug targets are diverse, aiming to inhibit specific steps in the viral life cycle while minimizing toxicity to the host cell. A major class of targets is viral enzymes, crucial for viral replication. Viral polymerases (DNA polymerases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptase) are prime targets. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are commonly used to inhibit these enzymes. These analogs are structurally similar to natural nucleosides/nucleotides and are incorporated into the growing viral DNA or RNA chain, causing chain termination or producing non-functional genomes. Examples include acyclovir (for herpesviruses), tenofovir (for HBV and HIV), and sofosbuvir (for HCV). Non-nucleoside inhibitors bind to a site on the viral polymerase distinct from the active site, altering its conformation and inhibiting its activity. Examples include efavirenz (for HIV) and nevirapine (for HIV). Viral proteases are essential for processing viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Protease inhibitors bind to the active site of the viral protease, preventing cleavage of the polyprotein and blocking the maturation of new virions. Examples include ritonavir (for HIV), darunavir (for HIV), and glecaprevir (for HCV). Viral integrase is an enzyme unique to retroviruses, responsible for integrating the viral DNA into the host cell's genome. Integrase inhibitors, such as raltegravir, dolutegravir, and bictegravir (all for HIV), block this integration step. Viral entry is another important target. Fusion inhibitors, such as enfuvirtide (for HIV), block the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Attachment inhibitors prevent the binding of viral surface proteins to host cell receptors. Maraviroc (for HIV) is a CCR5 antagonist, blocking the interaction of HIV gp120 with the CCR5 co-receptor. Uncoating inhibitors, such as amantadine and rimantadine (for influenza A), block the uncoating step of the viral life cycle by interfering with the M2 ion channel protein. Other targets include viral proteins involved in assembly, release, and other stages of the viral life cycle.

Antiviral drug resistance is a significant clinical challenge, particularly for chronic viral infections that require long-term treatment. Resistance arises due to mutations in the viral genes encoding the target proteins of the antiviral drugs. The high mutation rate of many viruses, particularly RNA viruses, facilitates the rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains. These mutations alter the structure of the target protein, reducing its affinity for the antiviral drug. For example, mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene are common causes of resistance to nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene confer resistance to protease inhibitors. Mutations in the influenza virus neuraminidase gene can lead to resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir). The selection pressure exerted by the antiviral drug favors the survival and replication of drug-resistant strains. To minimize the development of resistance, combination therapy (using multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action) is often employed, particularly for HIV and HCV infections. Genotypic resistance testing, which involves sequencing the relevant viral genes to identify resistance mutations, is used to guide treatment decisions, especially in cases of treatment failure. The development of new antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action is crucial to overcome drug resistance.

Vaccines are the most effective means of preventing viral infections. They work by stimulating the host immune system to produce a protective immune response (antibodies and/or T cell responses) against the virus. Different types of vaccines exist: Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened versions of the virus that can replicate but do not cause disease (or cause only mild disease). They elicit a strong and long-lasting immune response, often similar to that induced by natural infection. Examples include the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, and the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Inactivated vaccines contain killed viruses that cannot replicate. They are generally safer than live attenuated vaccines but may require multiple doses to achieve protective immunity. Examples include the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), the influenza vaccine (most formulations), and the hepatitis A vaccine. Subunit vaccines contain only specific viral antigens (e.g., proteins) rather than the whole virus. They are very safe but may require adjuvants (substances that enhance the immune response) to be effective. Examples include the hepatitis B vaccine (containing the hepatitis B surface antigen) and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Recombinant vector vaccines use a harmless virus or bacterium (the vector) to deliver viral genes to host cells, which then express the viral antigens, eliciting an immune response. Examples include some Ebola vaccines and some COVID-19 vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a newer technology, delivering mRNA encoding a viral antigen (e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) to host cells. The host cells then produce the viral antigen, triggering an immune response. mRNA vaccines are highly effective and can be rapidly developed. Examples include the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity vary depending on the vaccine and the virus. Neutralizing antibodies are crucial for preventing many viral infections, blocking viral entry into cells. Cell-mediated immunity (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) is important for controlling and clearing established viral infections.

Passive immunization involves the administration of preformed antibodies (immunoglobulins) to provide immediate, but temporary, protection against a viral infection. This is used for prophylaxis (prevention) in individuals who have been exposed to a virus and are at high risk of developing severe disease, or for treatment of certain viral infections. Examples include: Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), given to individuals exposed to HBV (e.g., after a needlestick injury) to prevent infection. Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG), given to susceptible individuals (e.g., immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women) exposed to VZV to prevent severe chickenpox. Rabies immune globulin (RIG), given along with the rabies vaccine after a potential rabies exposure. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immune globulin (palivizumab), a monoclonal antibody given to high-risk infants to prevent severe RSV infection. Passive immunization provides immediate protection, but the protection is short-lived (weeks to months) because the administered antibodies are gradually cleared from the body. It does not induce long-term immunity.
