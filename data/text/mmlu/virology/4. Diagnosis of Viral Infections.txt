Viral culture, while traditionally considered the gold standard for viral diagnosis, is increasingly being replaced by faster and more sensitive molecular methods. However, it remains valuable for certain viruses and for specific purposes, such as isolating novel viruses or characterizing viral strains for antiviral susceptibility testing. Viral culture involves inoculating clinical specimens (e.g., respiratory secretions, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue biopsies) onto susceptible cell lines. Different cell lines are used depending on the suspected virus, as viruses exhibit tropism for specific cell types. Commonly used cell lines include human embryonic lung fibroblasts, monkey kidney cells, and HeLa cells. The inoculated cells are incubated and monitored for the development of cytopathic effects (CPE), characteristic morphological changes in the cells caused by viral replication. CPE can include cell rounding, detachment, syncytia formation (cell fusion), or inclusion body formation. For some viruses, hemadsorption (the ability of infected cells to bind red blood cells) can be used to detect viral infection. Viral culture can take days to weeks to yield a positive result, depending on the virus and the viral load in the specimen. It requires specialized laboratory facilities and trained personnel. Furthermore, not all viruses can be readily cultured in the laboratory. Despite limitations, viral culture allows for the isolation of live virus, which can be further characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods.

Serology, the detection of viral antibodies in serum or other body fluids, is a widely used method for diagnosing viral infections. Serological assays detect either immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific for viral antigens. IgM antibodies typically appear early in the course of an infection (within days to weeks) and indicate a recent or current infection. IgG antibodies appear later (weeks to months) and can persist for years, indicating past infection or immunity. Commonly used serological assays include: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a widely used, sensitive, and automated method for detecting antibodies. ELISA can be designed to detect either IgM or IgG antibodies. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA), uses fluorescently labeled antibodies to detect viral antigens or antibodies in cells or tissues. Western blot, a more specific assay that can detect antibodies to individual viral proteins. It is often used as a confirmatory test for HIV infection. Neutralization assays, measure the ability of antibodies to neutralize the infectivity of the virus in cell culture. Interpretation of serological results requires careful consideration of the timing of sample collection relative to the onset of symptoms and the known kinetics of antibody responses for the specific virus. A single positive IgM result can suggest acute infection, but paired sera (acute and convalescent samples collected 2-4 weeks apart) showing a four-fold or greater rise in IgG titer are considered more definitive evidence of recent infection. Serology is less useful for diagnosing infections in immunocompromised individuals, who may have impaired antibody responses. It is also not suitable for detecting viruses that do not elicit a strong antibody response or for viruses that cause localized infections without significant systemic antibody production.

Molecular diagnostics have revolutionized viral diagnosis due to their high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid turnaround time. These methods detect viral nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) directly in clinical specimens. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the cornerstone of molecular diagnostics. PCR amplifies a specific target sequence of viral DNA, allowing for the detection of even very small amounts of viral genetic material. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is used for RNA viruses. It involves an initial step where reverse transcriptase (RT) converts the viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), which is then amplified by PCR. Real-time PCR (qPCR) or real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) allows for the quantification of viral load (the amount of virus present in a sample). This is particularly important for monitoring the response to antiviral therapy in chronic viral infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Real-time PCR assays incorporate fluorescent probes or dyes that allow for the detection of amplified DNA as it is being produced, providing quantitative results. Nucleic acid sequencing can be used to identify the specific virus or viral strain and to detect mutations associated with antiviral drug resistance. Sanger sequencing is the traditional method, but next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly used, allowing for high-throughput sequencing of entire viral genomes. NGS is particularly useful for identifying novel viruses and for characterizing viral populations. Molecular diagnostics are widely used for diagnosing a variety of viral infections, including respiratory infections (influenza, RSV, coronaviruses), HIV infection, hepatitis B and C, herpesvirus infections, and many others. They are particularly valuable for detecting viruses that are difficult or impossible to culture, for rapid diagnosis, and for monitoring viral load during antiviral therapy.

Antigen detection assays provide a rapid and relatively simple method for detecting viral proteins (antigens) directly in clinical specimens. These assays are often used as point-of-care tests, providing results within minutes. The most common format is the immunochromatographic assay (lateral flow assay). These assays use antibodies specific for viral antigens that are immobilized on a test strip. The sample (e.g., nasal swab, blood) is applied to the strip, and if the viral antigen is present, it will bind to the antibodies, producing a visible colored line. Rapid antigen tests are available for a variety of viruses, including influenza viruses, RSV, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2. While rapid antigen tests are convenient and fast, they are generally less sensitive than PCR or viral culture. This means they may produce false-negative results, particularly in individuals with low viral loads. Therefore, a negative rapid antigen test result may need to be confirmed by a more sensitive method, such as PCR, especially in situations where a definitive diagnosis is critical. The specificity of rapid antigen tests is generally high, meaning that false-positive results are less common. However, cross-reactivity with other viruses or with non-viral components of the sample can occur. The performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of rapid antigen tests can vary depending on the specific test, the virus, the population being tested, and the timing of sample collection relative to the onset of symptoms.
