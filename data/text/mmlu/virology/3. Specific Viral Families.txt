Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses characterized by their ability to establish lifelong latent infections. All herpesviruses have icosahedral capsids and linear, double-stranded DNA genomes. They are enveloped viruses. Key members and their associated diseases include: Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), typically associated with oral herpes (cold sores), but can also cause genital herpes, keratitis, and encephalitis. Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2), primarily causes genital herpes, but can also cause oral herpes and neonatal herpes. Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), causes chickenpox (varicella) as the primary infection and shingles (herpes zoster) upon reactivation from latency in sensory neurons. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common virus that usually causes asymptomatic infection in immunocompetent individuals, but can cause serious disease in immunocompromised individuals (retinitis, pneumonia, colitis) and congenital CMV infection. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), causes infectious mononucleosis ("mono") and is associated with several malignancies, including Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), cause roseola infantum (exanthem subitum), a common childhood illness. Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, a vascular tumor that is common in AIDS patients. Diagnosis of herpesvirus infections often involves PCR for viral DNA, serology (detecting antibodies), or viral culture. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, are available for treating HSV and VZV infections. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are used for CMV infections.

Retroviridae are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome. A defining feature is the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT), an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that converts the viral RNA into DNA, which then integrates into the host cell's genome using the viral enzyme integrase. The integrated viral DNA is called a provirus. Key members include: Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1), the most common cause of HIV infection and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV-1 infects CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, leading to progressive immune dysfunction. Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 2 (HIV-2), less common and less virulent than HIV-1, found primarily in West Africa. Human T-lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1), associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Human T-lymphotropic Virus type 2 (HTLV-2), less clearly associated with disease, but can cause a mild neurological disorder. Diagnosis of HIV infection involves serology (detecting antibodies to HIV) and confirmation with Western blot or PCR for viral RNA (viral load). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection targets multiple steps in the viral life cycle, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease, and entry/fusion. ART has dramatically improved the prognosis for HIV-infected individuals, but it does not cure the infection.

Flaviviridae are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Many are transmitted by arthropod vectors (mosquitoes or ticks). Important members include: Dengue Virus, causes dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness characterized by fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and rash. Severe dengue can lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are four serotypes of dengue virus, and infection with one serotype does not provide immunity to the others; in fact, it can increase the risk of severe disease upon subsequent infection with a different serotype (antibody-dependent enhancement). Zika Virus, primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, usually causes mild illness, but can cause congenital Zika syndrome (microcephaly and other birth defects) if a pregnant woman is infected. West Nile Virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause a range of symptoms from asymptomatic infection to fever, headache, and neurological disease (encephalitis, meningitis). Yellow Fever Virus, also mosquito-borne, causes a severe illness characterized by fever, jaundice, and bleeding. A highly effective vaccine is available for yellow fever. Japanese Encephalitis Virus, mosquito-borne, can cause severe encephalitis, primarily in Asia. Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, tick-borne, causes encephalitis in parts of Europe and Asia. Diagnosis of flavivirus infections often involves serology (detecting antibodies) or PCR for viral RNA. There are no specific antiviral treatments for most flavivirus infections; treatment is supportive.

Coronaviridae are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a characteristic "crown-like" appearance under electron microscopy due to their spike glycoproteins. Important members include: SARS-CoV-1 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1), caused the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory illness, ranging from mild to severe pneumonia, but can also affect other organs. MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), causes a severe respiratory illness, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula. Coronaviruses have relatively large RNA genomes and utilize a complex replication strategy involving the production of subgenomic mRNAs. Diagnosis of coronavirus infections typically involves PCR for viral RNA. Treatment for COVID-19 includes supportive care, antiviral drugs (remdesivir, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), and monoclonal antibodies. Vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19.

Orthomyxoviridae are enveloped viruses with a segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. The key members are the influenza viruses: Influenza A virus is the most important cause of human influenza and is responsible for seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins (e.g., H1N1, H3N2). Antigenic drift (gradual accumulation of mutations in HA and NA) leads to seasonal variations in influenza viruses. Antigenic shift (reassortment of genome segments between different influenza A virus strains) can result in the emergence of novel strains with pandemic potential. Influenza B virus also causes seasonal influenza, but typically less severe than influenza A. Influenza C virus causes mild respiratory illness. Diagnosis of influenza involves rapid antigen tests, PCR for viral RNA, or viral culture. Antiviral drugs for influenza include neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) and the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for prevention.

Paramyxoviridae are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. Important members include: Measles virus, causes measles, a highly contagious disease characterized by fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a characteristic maculopapular rash. Complications of measles can include pneumonia, encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare, fatal, progressive neurological disorder. Mumps virus, causes mumps, characterized by swelling of the parotid glands (parotitis). Complications can include orchitis (inflammation of the testes), oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries), meningitis, and encephalitis. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (bronchiolitis and pneumonia) in infants and young children. Human Parainfluenza Viruses (HPIVs), cause a range of respiratory illnesses, including croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) is another important cause of respiratory illness similar to RSV Nipah Virus and Hendra Virus emerging zoonotic paramyxoviruses. Diagnosis typically involves PCR, serology or viral culture. There are no specific antiviral treatments for most paramyxovirus infections; treatment is supportive. The MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) is highly effective in preventing measles and mumps. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody used for prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants.

Picornaviridae are non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The family includes: Enteroviruses, a large group that includes Poliovirus, causes poliomyelitis (polio), a disease that can lead to paralysis. Effective vaccines have dramatically reduced the incidence of polio worldwide. Coxsackieviruses (group A and group B), cause a variety of illnesses, including hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Echoviruses, can cause a range of illnesses, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and respiratory infections. Rhinoviruses, the most common cause of the common cold. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), causes acute hepatitis A, a liver infection transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A vaccine is available for hepatitis A. Diagnosis of picornavirus infections often involves PCR, viral culture, or serology. There are no specific antiviral treatments for most picornavirus infections, except for hepatitis A, treatment is generally supportive.

Hepadnaviridae are small, enveloped DNA viruses with a partially double-stranded, circular DNA genome. The key member is Hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV replicates through an RNA intermediate, using a virally encoded reverse transcriptase, unusual for a DNA virus. HBV causes acute and chronic hepatitis. Chronic HBV infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV is transmitted through blood and body fluids. Diagnosis of HBV infection involves serological tests for various HBV antigens and antibodies (HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HBe). These markers help distinguish acute infection, chronic infection, immunity from vaccination, and past infection. Antiviral drugs for chronic HBV infection include nucleos(t)ide analogs (entecavir, tenofovir) and interferon-alpha. A highly effective vaccine is available to prevent HBV infection.
