Viral injury mechanisms are diverse, encompassing direct and indirect effects on infected cells and tissues. Direct cytopathic effects (CPE) result from the virus disrupting cellular processes essential for cell survival. This can include inhibition of host cell macromolecular synthesis (DNA, RNA, protein), disruption of the cytoskeleton, induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis (uncontrolled cell death), and formation of syncytia (fusion of infected cells with neighboring cells, creating multinucleated giant cells, as seen with HIV and RSV). Some viruses produce toxic viral proteins that directly damage cellular structures. Immune-mediated damage is a significant contributor to viral pathogenesis. While the immune response is crucial for controlling viral infections, it can also cause tissue damage. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill virus-infected cells, which is essential for clearing the infection but can also result in tissue destruction, as seen in hepatitis B virus infection, where liver damage is primarily caused by the CTL response to infected hepatocytes. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation can also contribute to inflammation and tissue damage. In some cases, viral infections can trigger autoimmune responses, leading to prolonged tissue damage even after the virus is cleared. Viral oncogenesis, the ability of certain viruses to cause cancer, involves complex mechanisms. Some viruses integrate their DNA into the host cell genome, potentially disrupting cellular genes or inserting viral oncogenes (genes that promote uncontrolled cell growth). This is termed insertional mutagenesis. Other viruses encode oncoproteins that interfere with cellular growth control pathways. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein binds to and inactivates the tumor suppressor protein p53, and E7 protein binds to and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), both critical regulators of the cell cycle. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes proteins that mimic cellular growth signals, driving B cell proliferation. Other mechanisms of viral pathogenesis include altered cell signaling pathways, disruption of cell-cell junctions, and induction of inflammation.

Viral immune evasion strategies are crucial for viral persistence and pathogenesis, allowing viruses to circumvent the host's defenses. Antigenic variation is a common mechanism, particularly in RNA viruses with high mutation rates. By constantly changing their surface antigens (e.g., glycoproteins), viruses can evade neutralizing antibodies and T cell recognition. Influenza viruses exhibit antigenic drift (gradual accumulation of mutations) and antigenic shift (reassortment of genome segments), leading to new strains that can escape pre-existing immunity. HIV also undergoes rapid antigenic variation due to the error-prone nature of reverse transcriptase. Interference with interferon (IFN) signaling is another key strategy. Interferons are cytokines that induce an antiviral state in cells, inhibiting viral replication. Many viruses encode proteins that block different steps in the IFN signaling pathway, preventing the establishment of this antiviral state. Inhibition of apoptosis is a mechanism used by some viruses to prolong the survival of infected cells, allowing for continued viral replication. Viral proteins can block the activation of caspases (enzymes involved in apoptosis) or interfere with other pro-apoptotic signals. Downregulation of MHC class I expression is a strategy to evade CTL recognition. MHC class I molecules present viral antigens on the surface of infected cells, allowing CTLs to recognize and kill them. Some viruses encode proteins that interfere with the synthesis, assembly, or transport of MHC class I molecules, reducing their surface expression. Latency, discussed below, is also a form of immune evasion, as the virus remains hidden from the immune system in a dormant state. Other mechanisms include production of viral homologs of cytokines or cytokine receptors (acting as decoys), and inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell activity.

Viral latency is a state where the virus persists within the host cell in a non-replicative or minimally replicative state, avoiding detection and elimination by the immune system. Different viruses establish latency in different cell types. Herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), establish latency in sensory neurons. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes latency in B lymphocytes. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can establish latency in myeloid progenitor cells and other cell types. HIV establishes latency primarily in resting memory CD4+ T cells. The mechanisms of latency vary depending on the virus. In herpesviruses, the viral genome persists as an episome (a circular DNA molecule) in the nucleus of the infected cell, with limited viral gene expression. In HIV, the proviral DNA (integrated viral DNA) is transcriptionally silent or expresses only a few viral genes in latently infected cells. Reactivation of latent viruses can occur in response to various stimuli, such as stress, immunosuppression, or other infections. Reactivation involves a switch from the latent state to a lytic replication cycle, leading to the production of new virions and often causing clinical symptoms. For example, reactivation of VZV can cause shingles (herpes zoster). Understanding the mechanisms of viral latency and reactivation is crucial for developing strategies to cure or control latent viral infections.

Viral oncogenesis, as mentioned before, involves complex interplay between viral and cellular factors. Oncogenic viruses are classified as either DNA viruses (e.g., HPV, EBV, HBV, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV/HHV-8]) or RNA viruses (e.g., HTLV-1). Insertional mutagenesis, as a mechanism, is where integration of the viral genome into the host cell DNA disrupts a tumor suppressor gene or activates a proto-oncogene, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. This is more common with retroviruses. However, expression of viral oncoproteins is a more frequent mechanism. These oncoproteins interfere with crucial cellular regulatory pathways. As examples: HPV E6 and E7 proteins, mentioned earlier, inactivate p53 and Rb, respectively. EBV's LMP1 protein mimics CD40 signaling, promoting B cell survival and proliferation. HTLV-1 Tax protein activates transcription factors that promote cell growth and inhibits DNA repair. KSHV/HHV-8 encodes several oncoproteins, including a viral homolog of cyclin D, which drives cell cycle progression. HBV's HBx protein has multiple functions, including interfering with DNA repair and cell cycle control. It's important to note that viral infection alone is often not sufficient to cause cancer; additional factors, such as host genetic susceptibility, immune status, and environmental exposures, play a role in the development of virus-associated malignancies.
