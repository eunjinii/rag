Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest triggered by various stressors, most notably telomere shortening. Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. When telomeres reach a critically short length, they trigger a DNA damage response, leading to senescence. The Hayflick limit refers to the finite number of times a normal human cell population will divide before cellular senescence. Senescent cells, while no longer dividing, remain metabolically active and secrete a complex mixture of factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP includes pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, which can have both beneficial (e.g., wound healing, tumor suppression) and detrimental (e.g., chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction) effects. Accumulation of cellular damage, including DNA damage (mutations, oxidative damage), protein damage (misfolding, aggregation), and lipid damage (peroxidation), contributes to cellular senescence and aging.

Oxidative stress is a major contributor to aging, resulting from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's antioxidant defenses. ROS, including superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, are byproducts of normal metabolism, particularly in the mitochondria. These highly reactive molecules can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to cellular dysfunction. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, neutralize ROS. However, with age, antioxidant defenses may decline, and ROS production may increase, leading to a state of oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a key feature of aging, contributes to increased ROS production and decreased ATP production. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is more susceptible to damage than nuclear DNA, further exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction, creating a vicious cycle.

Inflammation, specifically chronic, low-grade inflammation termed "inflammaging," is increasingly recognized as a central feature of aging. Inflammaging is characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, in the absence of acute infection. The sources of this chronic inflammation are multifactorial, including senescent cells (via the SASP), the gut microbiome, and age-related changes in the immune system. The innate immune system becomes chronically activated, while the adaptive immune system declines in function (immunosenescence). Inflammaging contributes to the development of many age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

Genetic and epigenetic factors play a significant role in determining lifespan and the rate of aging. Certain genes have been associated with longevity, including FOXO3 (a transcription factor involved in stress resistance and metabolism) and SIRT1 (a sirtuin, a protein deacetylase involved in DNA repair and metabolism). Polymorphisms (variations) in these genes can influence lifespan. Epigenetic modifications, which are changes in gene expression without alterations in the DNA sequence, also contribute to aging. DNA methylation patterns change with age, typically with global hypomethylation and hypermethylation at specific gene promoters. Histone acetylation, another epigenetic modification, also changes with age, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression. The heritability of lifespan, while complex, suggests a significant genetic component to aging. Gene-environment interactions are also crucial, as environmental factors (diet, lifestyle, exposure to toxins) can influence gene expression and the aging process.

Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is essential for maintaining cellular function. It involves the proper folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins. Chaperones, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), assist in protein folding and prevent aggregation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary pathway for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins. Proteins tagged with ubiquitin are targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Autophagy is another crucial degradation pathway, involving the engulfment of cellular components, including misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, in autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes for degradation. With age, proteostasis declines, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates. This accumulation is particularly detrimental in post-mitotic cells like neurons, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) and Parkinson's disease (Lewy bodies containing α-synuclein). Impaired proteostasis is thus a key contributor to the aging process and age-related diseases.
