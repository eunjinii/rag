Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary diagnostic process designed to evaluate an older person's medical, functional, cognitive, and psychosocial status. It goes beyond the traditional medical model, focusing on the whole person and their overall well-being. The CGA is typically performed by an interdisciplinary team, which may include a physician (often a geriatrician), nurse, social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and pharmacist. The goal is to identify geriatric syndromes (common clinical conditions in older adults that don't fit into discrete disease categories, such as falls, incontinence, delirium, and frailty), develop a coordinated care plan, and optimize the older person's health, function, and quality of life. The CGA typically includes a detailed medical history and physical examination, focusing on age-related changes and common geriatric conditions. Functional assessment is a crucial component, evaluating the individual's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Cognitive assessment screens for cognitive impairment and dementia. Psychosocial assessment explores social support, mental health, and living situation. The CGA results in a problem list, prioritized based on the individual's needs and goals, and a care plan that addresses these problems.

Polypharmacy, the use of multiple medications, is extremely common in older adults due to the increased prevalence of chronic diseases. While sometimes necessary, polypharmacy increases the risk of drug interactions, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and non-adherence. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to ADRs due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes drugs) and pharmacodynamics (how drugs affect the body). The Beers Criteria, developed by the American Geriatrics Society, are a list of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) for older adults, highlighting medications that may have a higher risk of adverse effects in this population. Deprescribing, the process of systematically reviewing and discontinuing medications that are no longer necessary or may be causing harm, is an important strategy to address polypharmacy. Medication reconciliation, a formal process of comparing a patient's medication orders to all of the medications that the patient has been taking, is crucial at transitions of care (e.g., hospital admission, discharge) to prevent medication errors.

Functional status assessment is a critical component of geriatric care, as it reflects an individual's ability to perform daily tasks and maintain independence. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are basic self-care tasks, including bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring (moving from bed to chair), and eating. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are more complex tasks necessary for independent living, such as using the phone, managing finances, preparing meals, shopping, and taking medications. Standardized tools, such as the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, are used to assess functional status. Decline in functional status can be an early indicator of underlying illness or worsening of chronic conditions. Maintaining or improving functional status is a primary goal of geriatric care.

Cognitive assessment is essential in older adults, as cognitive impairment is common and can have a significant impact on function and quality of life. Screening for cognitive impairment is recommended for all older adults, particularly those with risk factors or reported concerns. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely used, brief cognitive screening tool that assesses orientation, memory, attention, language, and visuospatial skills. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is another screening tool that is more sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than the MMSE. A low score on a screening test does not definitively diagnose dementia but indicates the need for further evaluation. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for dementia involves a detailed history (from the patient and a reliable informant), physical and neurological examination, cognitive testing, and, in some cases, neuroimaging (CT or MRI) and laboratory tests to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment.
