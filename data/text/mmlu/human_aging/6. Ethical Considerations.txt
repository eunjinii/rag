End-of-life care presents unique ethical challenges, particularly in the context of aging. Advance care planning is a crucial process that involves individuals making decisions about their future healthcare preferences, in the event that they become unable to make decisions for themselves. Advance directives are legal documents that allow individuals to express their wishes regarding medical treatment. A living will specifies the types of medical treatments an individual would or would not want if they are terminally ill or permanently unconscious. A durable power of attorney for healthcare (also known as a healthcare proxy) designates a person to make healthcare decisions on behalf of the individual if they become incapacitated. These documents help ensure that patients' autonomy is respected, even when they are no longer able to express their wishes directly. Hospice and palliative care are specialized forms of care that focus on improving the quality of life for individuals with serious illnesses. Palliative care can be provided at any stage of a serious illness, alongside curative treatments. Hospice care is a specific type of palliative care for individuals with a terminal illness and a prognosis of six months or less to live, if the illness runs its normal course. Both hospice and palliative care focus on symptom management, pain relief, and emotional and spiritual support for patients and their families. Ethical dilemmas often arise in end-of-life decision-making. These can include decisions about withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments (e.g., mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration), decisions about resuscitation (CPR), and decisions about the appropriate level of aggressiveness of care. The principles of medical ethics (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) guide decision-making in these complex situations. Shared decision-making, involving the patient (if possible), the healthcare team, and the family, is essential.

Ageism, discrimination and prejudice based on age, is a pervasive issue that affects older adults in various aspects of life, including healthcare, employment, and social interactions. Ageism can manifest as negative stereotypes about older adults, portraying them as frail, incompetent, or burdensome. These stereotypes can lead to discriminatory practices, such as denial of healthcare services, exclusion from employment opportunities, and social isolation. In healthcare, ageism can result in undertreatment of medical conditions, inadequate pain management, and exclusion from clinical trials. Ageism can also influence healthcare providers' communication and decision-making, leading to less patient-centered care. Addressing ageism requires challenging negative stereotypes, promoting positive images of aging, and advocating for policies that protect the rights and well-being of older adults. Education of healthcare professionals and the public about the realities of aging and the diversity of the older adult population is crucial.
