The cardiovascular system undergoes significant changes with age. Cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute, tends to decrease due to a combination of factors, including decreased heart rate (due to changes in the sinoatrial node, the heart's natural pacemaker) and decreased stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat). Stroke volume decreases, in part, due to increased stiffness of the left ventricle, reducing its ability to fill efficiently during diastole. Arterial stiffness increases with age due to changes in the composition of the arterial walls, including increased collagen and decreased elastin. This increased stiffness leads to increased systolic blood pressure and increased afterload on the heart. Baroreceptor sensitivity, the ability of the body to sense and respond to changes in blood pressure, decreases with age. This can lead to orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing) and increased susceptibility to blood pressure fluctuations. These physiological changes increase the risk of several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure (the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs), and coronary artery disease (narrowing of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis).

The respiratory system also experiences age-related declines. Lung elasticity decreases due to changes in connective tissue (loss of elastin and increased collagen), making it harder for the lungs to expand and contract. This leads to decreased vital capacity (the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a maximal inhalation) and increased residual volume (the amount of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation). The alveolar surface area, where gas exchange occurs, decreases with age. This reduces the efficiency of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal. The respiratory muscles (diaphragm and intercostal muscles) may weaken with age, further contributing to decreased ventilatory capacity. These changes increase the risk of respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly in smokers.

The musculoskeletal system is significantly affected by aging. Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, is a major contributor to functional decline. It results from a decrease in the number and size of muscle fibers, as well as decreased protein synthesis and increased protein breakdown. Decreased bone density, known as osteoporosis, is another common age-related change, particularly in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone formation (by osteoblasts) and bone resorption (by osteoclasts), leading to weakened bones and increased risk of fractures. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown, is also common with age, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility. These musculoskeletal changes increase the risk of falls, fractures, and disability.

The nervous system undergoes complex changes with age. Cognitive decline is a common feature of aging, although it's important to distinguish between normal age-related changes and dementia. Normal aging is associated with some degree of decline in processing speed, working memory, and executive function. However, these changes are typically mild and do not significantly interfere with daily activities. In contrast, dementia is a pathological decline in cognitive function that significantly impairs daily life. The brain undergoes structural changes with age, including decreased brain volume (particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus), loss of neurons, and decreased synaptic plasticity. Sensory acuity also declines with age. Presbyopia (age-related farsightedness) is nearly universal, resulting from decreased lens elasticity. Cataracts (clouding of the lens) and age-related macular degeneration (damage to the macula, the central part of the retina) are common causes of vision impairment. Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss), particularly for high-frequency sounds, is also common, resulting from damage to the hair cells in the cochlea. The risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (characterized by amyloid plaques and
