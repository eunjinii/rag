Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in older adults. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is extremely common with age, primarily due to increased arterial stiffness. It is a major risk factor for other cardiovascular diseases. Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to angina (chest pain) and myocardial infarction (heart attack). Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can result from various causes, including CAD, hypertension, and valvular heart disease. Systolic heart failure involves impaired contraction, while diastolic heart failure involves impaired relaxation and filling. Stroke, a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, can be ischemic (caused by a blockage) or hemorrhagic (caused by bleeding). Stroke is a major cause of disability and death in older adults. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) involves atherosclerosis in the arteries of the limbs, most commonly the legs. It can cause claudication (pain with walking) and, in severe cases, can lead to limb ischemia and amputation.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. The pathological hallmarks of AD are the accumulation of amyloid plaques (extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid protein) and neurofibrillary tangles (intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein). Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. The pathological hallmark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain involved in motor control. Lewy bodies, abnormal aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein, are also present in PD. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Lewy bodies are present in both the cortex and brainstem. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of disorders characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, and language, due to degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Different subtypes of FTD are associated with different protein aggregates (e.g., tau, TDP-43).

Cancers become more prevalent with age, due to a combination of factors, including accumulated DNA damage, decreased immune surveillance, and longer exposure to carcinogens. The risk of many common cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancer, increases significantly with age. Cancer screening guidelines for older adults are often individualized, taking into account life expectancy and potential benefits and harms of screening.

Osteoporosis and fractures are major health concerns in older adults, particularly women. Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased bone fragility. Risk factors include age, female sex, postmenopausal status, low body weight, family history, smoking, and certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids). Diagnosis is typically made using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, which measures BMD. Prevention and treatment include adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, weight-bearing exercise, and medications such as bisphosphonates (which inhibit bone resorption) and other agents that promote bone formation. Fractures, particularly hip fractures, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, often leading to functional decline and loss of independence.

Type 2 diabetes is increasingly common with age, due to a combination of increased insulin resistance and declining beta-cell function (the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin). Risk factors include age, obesity, family history, and certain ethnicities. Diagnosis is made based on elevated blood glucose levels, either fasting glucose, glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c (a measure of average blood glucose over the past 2-3 months). Management involves lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise), oral medications (e.g., metformin), and, in some cases, insulin. Complications of diabetes, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (kidney damage), and retinopathy (eye damage), are more prevalent in older adults.

Sensory impairments are highly prevalent in older adults and can significantly impact quality of life. Presbyopia, the age-related loss of near vision, is almost universal. Cataracts, clouding of the lens, are also very common and can be surgically corrected. Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, can lead to irreversible vision loss. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects the macula, the central part of the retina, causing central vision loss. Presbycusis, age-related hearing loss, is common, particularly for high-frequency sounds. It can lead to social isolation and communication difficulties.

Depression and anxiety are not a normal part of aging but are significant mental health concerns in older adults. Risk factors include chronic medical conditions, functional limitations, social isolation, and bereavement. Diagnosis can be challenging, as symptoms may overlap with those of dementia or other medical conditions. Treatment includes psychotherapy, medications (e.g., antidepressants), and social support. It's crucial to differentiate depression from dementia, as both can present with cognitive impairment, but depression is treatable.
