Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) is the specialty dedicated to women's health, encompassing reproductive physiology, pregnancy, childbirth, and disorders of the female reproductive system. Foundational knowledge begins with reproductive physiology and endocrinology. Female reproductive anatomy includes the external genitalia (vulva, labia, clitoris) and internal genitalia (vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries). The pelvic floor provides support. Breast anatomy and development are also relevant.

The menstrual cycle, central to female reproductive function, is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary. FSH stimulates follicle growth in the ovaries, and LH triggers ovulation. Estrogen and progesterone, produced by the ovaries, regulate the cycle's phases: follicular (pre-ovulatory), ovulation, and luteal (post-ovulatory). The endometrium undergoes proliferative (estrogen-driven) and secretory (progesterone-driven) changes. Fertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, typically occurs in the fallopian tube. The resulting zygote undergoes cell division, forming a blastocyst, which implants in the endometrium. Placentation, the development of the placenta, is crucial for fetal nourishment and gas exchange. Early embryonic development follows a precise sequence. Puberty marks the onset of reproductive capability, with characteristic hormonal and physical changes. Menopause, the cessation of menstruation, also involves significant hormonal shifts and associated symptoms. Neuroendocrinology deals with the impact of neurotransmitters and hormones in reproduction.

Obstetrics focuses on pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Prenatal care is essential. The initial prenatal visit includes a comprehensive history, physical examination, and risk assessment. Routine prenatal visits monitor maternal and fetal well-being. Prenatal screening and diagnosis involve ultrasound, genetic testing (e.g., chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, non-invasive prenatal testing [NIPT]), and screening for complications. Nutrition and exercise are important during pregnancy. Common pregnancy complaints (nausea, vomiting, back pain) are addressed. Patient education includes childbirth preparation and breastfeeding guidance.

Labor and delivery involve distinct stages: first (cervical dilation), second (fetal expulsion), and third (placental delivery). Fetal monitoring (electronic fetal monitoring) assesses fetal well-being. Pain management in labor often includes epidural anesthesia. Vaginal delivery can be spontaneous or operative (forceps, vacuum). Cesarean delivery is performed for various indications. Induction and augmentation of labor may be necessary. Shoulder dystocia and breech presentation are obstetric emergencies.

Postpartum care addresses maternal physiological changes (uterine involution, lochia – vaginal discharge). Postpartum complications include hemorrhage, infection, thromboembolism, and depression. Breastfeeding physiology and management of common problems are important. Postpartum contraception options are discussed. Newborn care includes initial assessment and stabilization.

High-risk pregnancies require specialized care. Preterm labor and birth (before 37 weeks) are major concerns. Preeclampsia and eclampsia (characterized by hypertension and proteinuria) can be life-threatening. Gestational diabetes requires careful management. Multiple gestation (twins, triplets) increases risks. Placenta previa (placenta covering the cervix) and abruptio placentae (placental separation) are obstetric emergencies. Fetal growth restriction requires close monitoring. Rh incompatibility can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn. Infections in pregnancy (TORCH infections – Toxoplasmosis, Other [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex – and Group B Streptococcus [GBS]) can affect the fetus. Medical complications, such as cardiac, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, and hematologic disorders can occur. Obstetric ultrasound is important for fetal assessment in different trimesters, and to assess the growth and complications.

Gynecology focuses on the health of the female reproductive system. Well-woman care includes routine gynecologic examinations (pelvic exam, Pap smear), breast examinations (clinical breast exam, mammography), contraception counseling and prescribing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and health maintenance (immunizations, lifestyle counseling).

Benign gynecologic disorders are common. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) has various causes. Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumors that can cause bleeding and pain. Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, causes pain and infertility. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial tissue within the uterine muscle. Pelvic pain (chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea – painful menstruation) can have multiple etiologies. Ovarian cysts (functional cysts, dermoid cysts, endometriomas) are common. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hormonal imbalances and ovarian cysts. Vulvovaginitis (inflammation of the vulva and vagina) can be caused by infections or irritants. Pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence involve pelvic floor dysfunction.

Gynecologic infections require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper reproductive tract. Vulvovaginitis can be caused by bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis (yeast infection), or trichomoniasis.

Infertility, the inability to conceive after one year of unprotected intercourse, requires a comprehensive evaluation of both partners. Causes include male factor, female factor (ovulatory dysfunction, tubal disease, endometriosis). Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) include in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Gynecologic oncology addresses cancers of the female reproductive system. Cervical cancer screening (Pap smear, HPV testing) is crucial for early detection. Endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, vulvar and vaginal cancers, and gestational trophoblastic disease require specialized treatment. Breast cancer is often managed in collaboration with surgical and medical oncologists. Family planning includes contraception, sterilization and abortion. Urogynecology includes urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.

Surgical procedures in OB/GYN are diverse. Obstetric procedures include cesarean delivery, operative vaginal delivery (forceps, vacuum), cervical cerclage (for cervical insufficiency), dilation and curettage (D&C), and external cephalic version (for breech presentation). Gynecologic procedures include hysterectomy (abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic), myomectomy (removal of fibroids), oophorectomy (removal of ovaries), salpingectomy (removal of fallopian tubes), laparoscopy (diagnostic and operative), hysteroscopy (diagnostic and operative), colposcopy and cervical biopsy, and endometrial biopsy.

Advanced topics and emerging fields are transforming OB/GYN. Reproductive genetics includes preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), prenatal genetic testing (chorionic villus sampling [CVS], amniocentesis), and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS), including laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery, and hysteroscopic surgery, aims to reduce surgical trauma. Female sexual dysfunction (hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female orgasmic disorder, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder) is increasingly recognized and addressed. Global women's health issues include maternal mortality, access to contraception, and female genital mutilation. Research, including clinical trials and basic science research, is constantly advancing the field. This concise summary provides a high-yield overview of key concepts in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Remember that integration of knowledge across different areas, and a patient-centered approach, are hallmarks of excellent care in this specialty.
