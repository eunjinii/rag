Urology is the medical and surgical specialty focusing on the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra) in both males and females, and the male reproductive system (testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate, penis). Fundamental principles start with urinary system anatomy and physiology. The kidneys filter blood, producing urine; nephrons are the functional units. Ureters transport urine to the bladder, which stores urine. The urethra carries urine out of the body. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Erythropoietin, produced by the kidneys, stimulates red blood cell production.

Male reproductive system anatomy and physiology includes the testes, which produce sperm (spermatogenesis) and testosterone. The epididymis stores and matures sperm. The vas deferens transports sperm. Seminal vesicles and the prostate contribute fluids to semen. The penis is responsible for erection and ejaculation.

Urologic embryology explains the development of the urinary and male reproductive systems. Congenital anomalies (hypospadias – abnormal urethral opening, cryptorchidism – undescended testicle, vesicoureteral reflux – backflow of urine from bladder to ureters) can result from developmental errors. Urologic pharmacology includes drugs affecting bladder function (anticholinergics, alpha-blockers, beta-3 agonists), drugs for erectile dysfunction (PDE5 inhibitors), drugs for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH: alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors), antibiotics for urinary tract infections, chemotherapy for urologic cancers, and hormonal therapy.

Clinical urology encompasses a wide range of disorders. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) include cystitis (bladder infection), pyelonephritis (kidney infection), and urethritis (urethral infection). Complicated UTIs occur in patients with structural or functional abnormalities. Recurrent UTIs and catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTI) require specific management.

Urinary incontinence (involuntary urine leakage) types include stress incontinence (leakage with increased abdominal pressure), urge incontinence (leakage with a sudden urge), overflow incontinence (leakage due to bladder overdistention), mixed incontinence, and neurogenic bladder (bladder dysfunction due to neurological conditions).

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) involves prostate enlargement, causing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Diagnosis includes digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and uroflowmetry. Treatment options include medications (alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) and surgery (transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP], laser therapy).

Prostate cancer screening involves PSA testing and DRE. Diagnosis requires a prostate biopsy. Staging includes the Gleason score and TNM staging. Treatment options include active surveillance, surgery (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. Prostatitis is the inflammation of the prostate.

Bladder cancer risk factors include smoking and occupational exposures. Hematuria (blood in urine) is a common symptom. Diagnosis involves cystoscopy and urine cytology. Staging is based on the TNM system. Treatment includes transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), cystectomy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.

Kidney (renal) cancer risk factors include smoking, obesity, and hypertension. It is often asymptomatic in early stages; later symptoms include flank pain and hematuria. Diagnosis involves imaging (CT, MRI). Treatment includes surgery (nephrectomy), targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

Testicular cancer risk factors include cryptorchidism. A painless testicular mass is the typical presentation. Diagnosis involves scrotal ultrasound and tumor markers (AFP, hCG, LDH). Treatment includes orchiectomy (removal of the testicle), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Urolithiasis (kidney stones) involves different types of stones (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric acid, struvite, cystine). Renal colic (severe flank pain) is a characteristic symptom. Diagnosis is made with imaging (non-contrast CT). Treatment includes pain management, hydration, medical expulsive therapy (alpha-blockers), lithotripsy (breaking up stones with shock waves), ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Metabolic evaluation is performed to identify the cause of stone formation for recurrent cases.

Male infertility causes include varicocele (enlarged veins in the scrotum), hormonal disorders, genetic factors, obstruction, and infections. Evaluation includes semen analysis, hormone testing, and imaging. Treatment may involve medical management, surgery, or assisted reproductive technologies (ART).

Erectile dysfunction (ED) causes include vascular disease, diabetes, neurological disorders, medications, and psychological factors. Diagnosis involves history, physical examination, and hormone testing. Treatment options include lifestyle modifications, medications (PDE5 inhibitors), vacuum erection devices, and penile implants. Peyronie's disease is the penile curvature due to fibrous plaques. Voiding dysfunction includes overactive bladder and neurogenic bladder. Hematuria can be microscopic or gross, with variety of causes. Proteinuria requires further evaluation for the cause.

Diagnostic procedures in urology include urinalysis (dipstick analysis, microscopic examination), urine culture (identifying pathogens), imaging studies (intravenous pyelogram [IVP] – less common now, computed tomography [CT: CT urogram, non-contrast CT for stones], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasound [renal, scrotal, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) of the prostate], voiding cystourethrogram [VCUG] for vesicoureteral reflux, retrograde pyelogram), cystoscopy (visualization of bladder and urethra), urodynamic studies (assessing bladder function: cystometry, uroflowmetry, pressure flow studies), prostate biopsy (transrectal ultrasound [TRUS]-guided biopsy – the definitive diagnostic test for prostate cancer), and semen analysis (evaluating male fertility).

Therapeutic interventions include pharmacological therapies (antibiotics for UTIs, alpha-blockers for BPH and stones, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for BPH, anticholinergics for overactive bladder, PDE5 inhibitors for ED, hormonal therapy for prostate cancer).

Surgical procedures include transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for BPH, radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, nephrectomy (removal of kidney), cystectomy (removal of bladder), orchiectomy (removal of testicle), lithotripsy for kidney stones, ureteroscopy for kidney stones and ureteral disorders, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for large kidney stones, vasectomy (male sterilization) , hydrocelectomy, varicocelectomy and penile prosthesis. Minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopic and robotic surgery are used for some procedures. Endourology are the procedures performed through urethra.

Advanced topics and emerging fields include female urology (urogynecology: pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence), neurourology (neurogenic bladder), reconstructive urology (urethroplasty – repair of urethral strictures, bladder augmentation), pediatric urology (hypospadias, cryptorchidism and vesicoureteral reflux), oncology (urologic cancers: advanced therapies like targeted therapy and immunotherapy), regenerative medicine in urology, and robotics in urology (robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery). This summary provides a high-yield overview of key concepts in Urology. Remember to integrate your knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathology with clinical presentations, diagnostic techniques, and treatment options. Urology is a rapidly evolving field, so staying current with new developments is important.
