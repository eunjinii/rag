Orthopedics is the medical specialty focused on the musculoskeletal system â€“ bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and nerves. Foundational knowledge begins with musculoskeletal anatomy and physiology. Bone, comprised of cortical (dense) and cancellous (spongy) types, has a rich blood supply and innervation. Cartilage (hyaline, fibrocartilage, elastic) provides cushioning and smooth joint surfaces. Joints are classified as synovial (freely movable), fibrous (immovable), or cartilaginous (slightly movable). Skeletal muscles, responsible for movement, contract via the sliding filament mechanism. Tendons connect muscles to bones, and ligaments connect bones to bones, providing stability. Skeletal development involves endochondral and intramembranous ossification, with growth plates (physes) responsible for longitudinal bone growth. Biomechanics studies the forces acting on the musculoskeletal system, including gait analysis.

Bone and joint pathology encompasses a wide range of conditions. Fractures are classified by location, pattern, and displacement; their healing progresses through inflammatory, reparative, and remodeling phases. Complications include nonunion (failure to heal), malunion (healing in an incorrect position), and compartment syndrome (increased pressure within a muscle compartment). Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone density, increasing fracture risk. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease, involves cartilage breakdown and joint space narrowing. Inflammatory arthritides (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, gout) involve autoimmune or inflammatory processes affecting joints. Infections (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis) can be devastating. Bone tumors can be benign or malignant, primary or metastatic. Metabolic bone diseases include osteomalacia, rickets and Paget's disease.

The physical examination of the musculoskeletal system is crucial for diagnosis. It includes inspection (observing for deformities, swelling, asymmetry), palpation (feeling for tenderness, crepitus), assessing range of motion (active and passive), muscle strength testing (graded 0-5), and neurovascular assessment (checking pulses, sensation). Specific joint examinations (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee, ankle, foot, spine) are essential, along with special tests (provocative maneuvers) to assess specific structures (e.g., Lachman test for ACL tear, McMurray test for meniscal tear). Gait analysis assesses walking patterns.

Imaging plays a vital role in orthopedics. Radiographs (X-rays) are the initial imaging modality for most bone and joint problems. Computed tomography (CT) provides detailed bone imaging, particularly useful for complex fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior for visualizing soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, cartilage, muscles) and bone marrow. Ultrasound is used for real-time imaging of soft tissues and guiding injections. Bone scintigraphy (bone scan) assesses bone metabolism. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measures bone mineral density, used for diagnosing osteoporosis.

Orthopedic treatment encompasses both non-operative and operative approaches. Non-operative management includes rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), immobilization (casting, bracing), physical therapy, and medications (analgesics, anti-inflammatories). Operative management includes fracture fixation (internal fixation with plates, screws, rods; external fixation), joint replacement (arthroplasty), arthroscopy (minimally invasive joint surgery), soft tissue repair, and, in rare cases, amputation. Rehabilitation is crucial for restoring strength, range of motion, and function after injury or surgery. Pain management, both acute and chronic, often requires a multimodal approach.

Orthopedic subspecialties focus on specific areas. Trauma involves managing acute musculoskeletal injuries, including fractures. Principles of fracture reduction (restoring alignment) and fixation are fundamental. Polytrauma management addresses multiple injuries. Compartment syndrome, a surgical emergency, requires prompt diagnosis and fasciotomy (surgical release of pressure). Open fractures require meticulous management to prevent infection. Sports medicine addresses injuries related to athletic activity. Common injuries include ligament sprains, muscle strains, tendonitis, meniscal tears, and rotator cuff tears. Arthroscopy is frequently used for diagnosis and treatment. Ligament reconstruction (e.g., ACL reconstruction) is common. Return-to-play decisions require careful assessment.

Joint replacement (arthroplasty) is a major area, focusing on restoring function and relieving pain in patients with severe arthritis. Total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) are common procedures, with various surgical approaches, implant types, and potential complications. Shoulder, elbow, wrist, and ankle arthroplasty are less common. Revision arthroplasty addresses failed joint replacements. Spine surgery often overlaps with neurosurgery. It addresses degenerative disc disease (cervical and lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis), spinal deformity (scoliosis, kyphosis), spinal trauma, and spinal tumors. Surgical techniques include laminectomy (removing part of the vertebra), discectomy (removing a herniated disc), fusion (joining vertebrae), and instrumentation (using rods and screws).

Hand and upper extremity surgery requires specialized knowledge of the complex anatomy of the hand, wrist, and forearm. Conditions treated include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis (De Quervain's tenosynovitis, trigger finger), fractures and dislocations, nerve compression syndromes (cubital tunnel syndrome, radial tunnel syndrome), tendon and nerve repairs, and Dupuytren's contracture. Foot and ankle surgery addresses a wide range of conditions, including ankle sprains, Achilles tendon ruptures, fractures, bunions and hammertoes, plantar fasciitis, diabetic foot problems, and flatfoot/high-arched foot deformities.

Pediatric orthopedics focuses on the developing musculoskeletal system. It addresses congenital deformities (clubfoot, hip dysplasia, limb length discrepancies), developmental disorders (scoliosis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy), pediatric fractures (which have unique considerations due to growth plates), and sports injuries in children. Orthopedic oncology involves the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal tumors. Benign bone tumors include osteochondroma, enchondroma, and giant cell tumor. Malignant bone tumors include osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas also occur. Metastatic bone disease, the spread of cancer to bone, is a common and challenging problem. Limb salvage surgery aims to preserve limbs in patients with bone tumors.

Advanced topics and emerging fields are rapidly changing orthopedic practice. Regenerative medicine in orthopedics includes platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for tendon and ligament injuries and osteoarthritis, and stem cell therapy for potential cartilage and bone regeneration. Biomaterials used in orthopedics include metals (titanium, stainless steel, cobalt-chrome), polymers (polyethylene, PMMA bone cement), ceramics (hydroxyapatite), and biologics (bone grafts, bone morphogenetic proteins [BMPs]). Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS) utilizes navigation systems and robotic surgery to enhance precision in procedures like joint replacement and fracture fixation. Orthopedic research, including clinical trials and basic science research, is crucial for advancing the field. Orthobiologics refer to the use of biological substance to promote musculoskeletal healing. Value-based healthcare focuses on the cost-effectiveness, quality improvement and high-value care in Orthopedics. This concise summary provides a high-level overview of the key concepts in Orthopedics, suitable for last-minute review. Remember that a deep understanding of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, combined with strong clinical reasoning and examination skills, are essential for success in this field.
