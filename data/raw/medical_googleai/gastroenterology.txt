Gastroenterology is the specialty focused on the digestive system, encompassing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (from mouth to anus) and the liver, biliary system, and pancreas. Fundamental principles begin with GI anatomy and histology. The oral cavity includes teeth, tongue, and salivary glands. The pharynx and esophagus are involved in swallowing. The stomach, with its parietal cells (producing acid) and chief cells (producing pepsinogen), initiates digestion. The small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), with its villi and microvilli, is the primary site of nutrient absorption. The large intestine (cecum, colon, rectum, anus) absorbs water and houses the gut microbiota. The liver performs metabolic functions, detoxification, and bile production. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile. The pancreas has both exocrine (digestive enzymes) and endocrine (insulin, glucagon) functions. The peritoneum is the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity.

GI physiology describes how the digestive system works. Motility (peristalsis, segmentation) propels food through the GI tract. Secretion (gastric acid, pepsin, pancreatic enzymes, bile) aids digestion. Digestion breaks down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into absorbable units. Absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in digestion, immunity, and overall health. Neurohormonal control involves the enteric nervous system ("brain of the gut") and hormones (gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin [CCK]). Hepatic physiology includes bilirubin metabolism, protein synthesis, drug metabolism.

Gastrointestinal immunology is crucial. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) contains immune cells that protect against pathogens. Immune tolerance prevents reactions to food antigens and commensal bacteria. Inflammation, involving immune cells and cytokines, is central to many GI diseases. Gastrointestinal microbiology focuses on the normal gut flora (composition and function) and pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, parasites) that cause infections. Dysbiosis (alterations in the gut microbiota) is linked to various diseases.

Clinical gastroenterology encompasses a wide range of disorders. Esophageal disorders include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD: pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, complications like Barrett's esophagus), esophagitis (infectious, eosinophilic, drug-induced), achalasia (failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax), esophageal spasm, esophageal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma), hiatal hernia, mallory-weiss tear, and esophageal varices.

Stomach and duodenal disorders include gastritis (acute, chronic, Helicobacter pylori infection), peptic ulcer disease (PUD: gastric and duodenal ulcers, complications like bleeding and perforation), gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying), gastric cancer and Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.

Small intestinal disorders include malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease, lactose intolerance, short bowel syndrome), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), Crohn's disease (can affect any part of the GI tract), intestinal obstruction, and ischemic bowel disease.

Colorectal disorders include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS: diagnosis, management), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), diverticular disease (diverticulosis, diverticulitis), colorectal cancer (screening, diagnosis, treatment), constipation, diarrhea (acute, chronic, infectious, non-infectious), hemorrhoids, anal fissures, fecal incontinence and appendicitis.

Liver disorders include hepatitis (viral – A, B, C, D, E – autoimmune, alcoholic, drug-induced), cirrhosis (causes, complications like portal hypertension, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver failure (acute, chronic), liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma), hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC).

Biliary tract disorders include cholelithiasis (gallstones: pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment), cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct), cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts), biliary dyskinesia and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC).

Pancreatic disorders include acute pancreatitis (causes, diagnosis, management, complications), chronic pancreatitis (causes, diagnosis, management), pancreatic cancer (diagnosis, treatment), cystic fibrosis (affecting multiple organs, including the pancreas) and pancreatic insufficiency.

Gastrointestinal bleeding can be upper GI bleeding (causes: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices; diagnosis, management) or lower GI bleeding (causes: diverticulosis, colorectal cancer; diagnosis, management). Motility disorders includes achalasia, gastroparesis and Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction. Functional gastrointestinal disorders includes Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Functional Dyspepsia. Malnutrition can be consequence or cause of GI disorders, requiring nutrition intervention such as parenteral and enteral nutrition.

Diagnostic procedures are essential. Endoscopy includes upper endoscopy (EGD: visualization of esophagus, stomach, duodenum), colonoscopy (visualization of colon, rectum), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP: visualization of bile ducts, pancreatic duct), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS: imaging of GI tract wall, surrounding structures), capsule endoscopy (visualization of small intestine) and sigmoidoscopy. Radiology includes abdominal X-ray (plain films, contrast studies), computed tomography (CT: abdomen/pelvis), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI: MR enterography, MRCP), and ultrasound. Laboratory tests include liver function tests (LFTs: AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin), pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase), stool studies (cultures, fecal occult blood test, fecal calprotectin), serologic tests (for celiac disease, IBD, H. pylori), and hydrogen breath test. Manometry measures the pressures such as in esophageal and anorectal. pH monitoring primarily assess the acidity of the esophagus.

Therapeutic interventions include pharmacological therapies: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists for GERD and PUD, antacids for symptomatic relief, antibiotics for H. pylori and other infections, anti-inflammatory medications (aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics) for IBD, laxatives for constipation, antidiarrheals for diarrhea, antiemetics for nausea/vomiting, and prokinetics.

Endoscopic interventions include polypectomy (removal of polyps), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for larger lesions, ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction for choledocholithiasis, stent placement (esophageal, biliary, colonic), variceal banding and sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, dilation for strictures, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Surgical interventions include colectomy (for cancer, IBD, diverticulitis), small bowel resection, cholecystectomy (for gallstones), pancreatectomy (for cancer, chronic pancreatitis), liver transplantation (for end-stage liver disease), bariatric surgery (for morbid obesity). Dietary and lifestyle modification are important.

Advanced topics and emerging fields include transplant hepatology (liver transplantation: indications, evaluation, management), interventional gastroenterology (advanced endoscopic procedures), gastrointestinal motility disorders (gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction), and gut microbiome research (role in health and disease, fecal microbiota transplantation [FMT]). Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used such as AI-assisted polyp detection during colonoscopy. This summary provides a high-yield overview of key concepts in Gastroenterology. Remember to integrate your knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathology with clinical presentations and diagnostic/therapeutic approaches. The field is constantly evolving, so staying current with new developments is essential.
