Cardiovascular System

Cardiac and pulmonary systems are fundamentally intertwined, beginning with their shared developmental origins and continuing through their integrated physiological functions and shared pathologies. Anatomically, the heart's chambers, valves, and coronary circulation are paramount. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood, passing it to the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, then to the left ventricle, which pumps it systemically through the aorta. The heart's structure, including the myocardium, endocardium, epicardium, and pericardium, is crucial for its function. Histologically, cardiomyocytes, with their unique intercalated discs, facilitate rapid electrical conduction, essential for coordinated contraction. The specialized conduction system, including the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers, orchestrates the heart's rhythm.

Cardiac physiology revolves around the cardiac cycle, the sequence of events during one heartbeat. Systole is the contraction phase, where blood is ejected; diastole is the relaxation phase, where the chambers fill. Pressure-volume loops graphically depict this cycle, illustrating the interplay of pressure and volume changes. Cardiac output, the volume of blood pumped per minute, is the product of stroke volume (blood ejected per beat) and heart rate. Stroke volume is influenced by preload (ventricular filling), afterload (resistance against which the heart pumps), and contractility (intrinsic force of contraction). The Frank-Starling mechanism describes the heart's ability to increase stroke volume in response to increased preload. Autonomic innervation, sympathetic (increasing heart rate and contractility) and parasympathetic (decreasing heart rate), significantly modulates cardiac function.

Cardiac electrophysiology begins with the action potential, the rapid change in membrane potential that triggers contraction. Cardiomyocyte action potentials have a characteristic plateau phase due to calcium influx. Pacemaker cells in the SA node exhibit automaticity, spontaneously generating action potentials. The ECG reflects the sum of these electrical activities, providing crucial diagnostic information about heart rhythm and conduction.

Vascular anatomy includes arteries, which carry blood away from the heart, and veins, which return blood to the heart. The aorta, the largest artery, branches into progressively smaller arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, the sites of nutrient and gas exchange. Veins have thinner walls and valves to prevent backflow. Lymphatics collect interstitial fluid and return it to the circulation. Histologically, blood vessels have distinct layers: the intima (endothelium), media (smooth muscle), and adventitia (connective tissue). Endothelial cells play a critical role in regulating vascular tone, permeability, and coagulation.

Vascular physiology focuses on blood pressure regulation, hemodynamics, and microcirculation. Blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Short-term regulation involves baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, while long-term regulation involves the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Hemodynamics describes the physical principles of blood flow, including pressure, resistance, and flow rate. Poiseuille's law relates these factors. Microcirculation, the flow of blood through capillaries, is tightly regulated to meet tissue needs.

At the biochemical level, cardiac metabolism relies heavily on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP, primarily from fatty acids and glucose. Myocardial contractility is regulated by calcium handling. Calcium enters the cell during the action potential, triggering calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium binds to troponin, moving tropomyosin and allowing myosin to bind to actin, forming cross-bridges and generating force. Vascular smooth muscle contraction also depends on calcium, but the mechanisms differ, involving myosin light chain kinase and phosphatase. Endothelial cells produce vasoactive substances like nitric oxide (a vasodilator), endothelin (a vasoconstrictor), and prostacyclin (a vasodilator and antiplatelet agent), crucial for regulating vascular tone.

Pharmacological interventions target various aspects of cardiovascular function. Inotropes increase contractility (e.g., digoxin, dobutamine). Antiarrhythmics, classified by the Vaughan Williams system, treat abnormal heart rhythms (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone). Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and contractility. Calcium channel blockers reduce vascular resistance and contractility. ACE inhibitors and ARBs block the RAAS, lowering blood pressure. Diuretics reduce blood volume. Antiplatelets (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin) prevent clot formation. Vasodilators (e.g., nitrates) reduce preload and afterload. Vasoconstrictors (e.g., norepinephrine) increase blood pressure.

Inflammation plays a critical role in many cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of coronary artery disease, is a chronic inflammatory process involving lipid accumulation, immune cell infiltration, and plaque formation. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, often caused by viral infections. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium. Key immune cells (macrophages, T cells, B cells) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) contribute to these inflammatory processes. The complement system also plays a role. Infections, particularly infective endocarditis, can directly affect the heart. Common pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from stable angina (predictable chest pain with exertion) to acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack). Myocardial infarction occurs when a coronary artery is blocked, leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can be systolic (impaired contraction) or diastolic (impaired relaxation). Common causes include CAD, hypertension, and valvular disease. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification categorizes heart failure severity. Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms. They can be bradycardias (slow heart rate), tachycardias (fast heart rate), or irregular rhythms like atrial fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation are life-threatening arrhythmias. Valvular heart disease involves stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leakage) of heart valves. Hypertension is high blood pressure. It can be essential (no identifiable cause) or secondary (due to another condition). Congenital heart diseases are structural abnormalities present at birth. Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle. They can be dilated, hypertrophic, or restrictive. Pericardial diseases include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects arteries outside the heart and brain, often causing leg pain with walking (claudication). Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Aortic diseases include aneurysms (bulging) and dissection (tearing).

Diagnostic tools are essential for evaluating cardiovascular disease. The electrocardiogram (ECG) records the heart's electrical activity. Echocardiography uses ultrasound to visualize the heart's structure and function. Cardiac catheterization involves inserting a catheter into the heart to measure pressures and visualize the coronary arteries. Cardiac MRI and CT provide detailed images of the heart. Stress testing evaluates the heart's response to exercise. Blood tests, including cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB) and BNP (a marker of heart failure), are crucial.

Therapeutic interventions include medications (as described above), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to open blocked coronary arteries, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to bypass blocked arteries, valve replacement or repair, and pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for arrhythmias.

Pulmonary System

The pulmonary system's primary function is gas exchange: delivering oxygen to the blood and removing carbon dioxide. The respiratory tract begins with the upper airways (nose, pharynx, larynx) and continues with the lower airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli). The alveoli are tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs. The pulmonary vasculature includes the pulmonary arteries (carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart) and pulmonary veins (carrying oxygenated blood to the heart). The pleura is a double-layered membrane surrounding the lungs. The diaphragm and respiratory muscles drive ventilation. Histologically, the airways are lined by epithelial cells, including ciliated cells (which move mucus) and goblet cells (which produce mucus). Alveoli are lined by type I pneumocytes (thin cells for gas exchange) and type II pneumocytes (which produce surfactant). Alveolar macrophages engulf foreign particles.

Pulmonary physiology encompasses ventilation, gas exchange, and control of breathing. Ventilation is the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Lung volumes and capacities (e.g., tidal volume, vital capacity, total lung capacity) measure respiratory function. Gas exchange occurs across the alveolar-capillary membrane by diffusion. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. Ventilation-perfusion matching ensures that areas of the lung that are well-ventilated also receive adequate blood flow. Oxygen is transported in the blood bound to hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide is transported in several forms, including dissolved in plasma, bound to hemoglobin, and as bicarbonate ions. The control of breathing is regulated by central chemoreceptors (in the brainstem, sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide and pH) and peripheral chemoreceptors (in the carotid and aortic bodies, sensitive to changes in oxygen).

Acid-base balance is intimately linked to pulmonary function. The lungs regulate blood pH by controlling carbon dioxide levels. Respiratory acidosis occurs when there is an increase in carbon dioxide, and respiratory alkalosis occurs when there is a decrease in carbon dioxide. The kidneys compensate for respiratory acid-base disturbances. Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are caused by changes in bicarbonate levels.

Pulmonary biochemistry includes the role of surfactant, a lipoprotein produced by type II pneumocytes that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing their collapse. Signaling pathways are involved in lung development, inflammation, and repair. The genetic basis of several pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (caused by mutations in the CFTR gene) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, is well understood.

Pulmonary pharmacology includes bronchodilators (beta-agonists, anticholinergics, theophylline), which relax airway smooth muscle and are used to treat asthma and COPD. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation. Leukotriene modifiers block the action of leukotrienes, inflammatory mediators involved in asthma. Mast cell stabilizers prevent the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells. Mucolytics thin mucus. Oxygen therapy is essential for treating hypoxemia.

Inflammation is central to many pulmonary diseases. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchospasm, and mucus production. COPD, encompassing chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury characterized by widespread inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli. Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive scarring of the lungs. Immune cells (macrophages, T cells, B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, interferons) play key roles in these inflammatory processes.

Microbiology is crucial in understanding infectious pulmonary diseases. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma. It can be community-acquired, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated. Common bacterial causes include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Viral causes include influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Fungal pneumonia can occur in immunocompromised individuals. Tuberculosis is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other respiratory infections include bronchitis and bronchiolitis.

Obstructive lung diseases, including asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis, are characterized by airflow limitation. Restrictive lung diseases, including interstitial lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis), pneumoconiosis, and neuromuscular disorders, are characterized by reduced lung volumes. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. It can be primary (no identifiable cause) or secondary (due to another condition). Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of a pulmonary artery by a blood clot, often originating from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury. Pleural diseases include pleural effusion (fluid accumulation in the pleural space), pneumothorax (air in the pleural space), and empyema (pus in the pleural space). Lung cancer can be small cell or non-small cell. Sleep-disordered breathing includes obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea. Occupational lung diseases are caused by exposure to inhaled substances in the workplace.

Diagnostic techniques for pulmonary diseases include pulmonary function tests (PFTs), which measure lung volumes, airflow rates, and diffusion capacity. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) measure oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Chest radiography and CT are used to visualize the lungs. Bronchoscopy allows direct visualization of the airways.

Therapeutic interventions include medications (as described above), oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation (invasive and non-invasive), thoracentesis (removal of fluid from the pleural space), chest tube placement (to drain air or fluid from the pleural space), and bronchoscopy. Surgical interventions include lobectomy (removal of a lung lobe), pneumonectomy (removal of a lung), and lung transplantation. Pulmonary rehabilitation is an important component of management for many chronic lung diseases. Critical care management of respiratory failure involves hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical ventilation, and treatment of underlying conditions like sepsis and shock.
