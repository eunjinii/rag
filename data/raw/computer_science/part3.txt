Chapter 1: Relational Database Theory: Beyond Normalization

Goal: To provide a rigorous and in-depth understanding of the theoretical foundations of the relational model, going beyond basic normalization. This chapter covers advanced relational algebra and calculus, formal treatment of dependencies and normal forms, advanced query optimization principles, and limitations of normalization.

1.1 Relational Model Foundations

- 1.1.1 Formal Definitions (Review and Extension):
    - Relations: Formal set-theoretic definition. Relations as sets of tuples (not just tables). Distinction between relation schema and relation instance.
    - Attributes: Domains, atomic vs. composite attributes, null values (and their semantics – *important* for PhD level). Different interpretations of NULL (unknown, inapplicable, withheld).
    - Tuples: Ordered lists of values, one for each attribute.
    - Domains: Sets of atomic values. Data type considerations.
    - Keys:
        - Superkey: A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
        - Candidate Key: A minimal superkey (no proper subset is a superkey).
        - Primary Key: A designated candidate key.
        - Foreign Key: A set of attributes in one relation that refers to the candidate key of another relation (or the same relation). Referential integrity constraints.
    - Relational Database Schema: A set of relation schemas.
    - Relational Database Instance: A set of relation instances conforming to the schema.
- 1.1.2 Relational Algebra (Advanced):
    - Basic Operators (Review): Selection (σ), projection (π), union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (−), Cartesian product (×), rename (ρ).
    - Join Operators (Detailed Treatment):
        - Natural Join (⋈): Joining relations based on common attributes.
        - Theta Join (⋈<sub>θ</sub>): Joining relations based on a general condition (θ).
        - Equijoin: A theta join where the condition is equality.
        - Outer Joins (⟕, ⟖, ⟗): Left outer join, right outer join, full outer join. Handling unmatched tuples. *Formal* semantics of outer joins.
        - Semijoin (⋉, ⋊): Returns tuples from one relation that have matching tuples in another relation (but doesn't include the attributes from the second relation).
        - Antijoin (▷): Returns tuples that *don't* have matching tuples.
    - Division (÷): A less common, but theoretically important operator. Finding tuples in one relation that are related to *all* tuples in another relation. Formal definition and examples.
    - Aggregate Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX. Grouping (GROUP BY) and HAVING clause. *Formal* semantics of aggregation.
    - Relational Algebra Equivalences: Rules for transforming relational algebra expressions into equivalent expressions (for query optimization). Proofs of equivalence. Examples: pushing selections and projections, join ordering.
    - Limitations of Relational Algebra: Inability to express recursive queries.
- 1.1.3 Relational Calculus (Detailed Treatment):
    - Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC):
        - Syntax: Formulas built from atomic formulas (relation membership, attribute comparisons), logical connectives (¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔), and quantifiers (∃, ∀).
        - Semantics: Defining the meaning of TRC formulas with respect to a database instance. Free and bound variables.
        - Safe Expressions: Ensuring that the result of a TRC query is finite and depends only on the database instance (not on the potentially infinite domains). Syntactic restrictions on TRC formulas to guarantee safety.
        - Examples: Expressing various queries in TRC.
    - Domain Relational Calculus (DRC):
        - Syntax: Similar to TRC, but variables range over domain values instead of tuples.
        - Semantics: Defining the meaning of DRC formulas.
        - Safe Expressions: Syntactic restrictions to ensure safety.
        - Examples
    - Equivalence of Relational Algebra and Calculus: Proving that relational algebra and safe relational calculus expressions have the same expressive power (Codd's theorem).
    - Limitations of Relational Calculus: Similar to relational algebra (inability to express recursion).
- 1.1.4. Relational Completeness: Definition and examples.

1.2 Normalization Theory Revisited

- 1.2.1 Functional Dependencies (FDs):
    - Formal Definition: Given a relation schema R and sets of attributes X and Y, X → Y (X functionally determines Y) if, for any two tuples t1 and t2 in any instance of R, if t1[X] = t2[X], then t1[Y] = t2[Y].
    - Trivial and Non-Trivial FDs:
    - Armstrong's Axioms: A sound and complete set of inference rules for deriving FDs.
        - Reflexivity: If Y ⊆ X, then X → Y.
        - Augmentation: If X → Y, then XZ → YZ.
        - Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z, then X → Z.
        - Derived Rules: Union, decomposition, pseudotransitivity. *Proofs* of these derived rules.
    - Closure of a Set of FDs (F<sup>+</sup>): The set of all FDs that can be derived from a given set of FDs F using Armstrong's axioms. Algorithms for computing F<sup>+</sup> (exponential complexity).
    - Attribute Closure (X<sup>+</sup>): The set of all attributes that are functionally determined by a set of attributes X. Algorithms for computing X<sup>+</sup> (polynomial time). Use in determining candidate keys.
    - Minimal Cover (Canonical Cover): A minimal set of FDs that is equivalent to a given set of FDs (no redundant FDs, no extraneous attributes). Algorithms for finding a minimal cover.
- 1.2.2 Normal Forms (Review and Deeper Analysis):
    - 1NF (First Normal Form): All attributes are atomic (no repeating groups or nested relations).
    - 2NF (Second Normal Form): 1NF and no non-prime attribute is partially dependent on a candidate key. *Formal* definition using FDs and attribute closure.
    - 3NF (Third Normal Form): 1NF and for every non-trivial FD X → A, either X is a superkey or A is a prime attribute (part of a candidate key). *Formal* definition.
    - BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): 1NF and for every non-trivial FD X → A, X is a superkey. *Formal* definition. BCNF is a stronger form of 3NF.
    - Lossless-Join Decomposition: A decomposition of a relation schema into smaller schemas such that the original relation can be reconstructed by joining the decomposed relations. *Formal* definition and algorithms for testing lossless-join property.

- 1.2.3 Beyond BCNF:
    - Multivalued Dependencies (MVDs):
        - Definition: A generalization of functional dependencies. X →→ Y means that the set of Y values associated with a given X value is independent of the other attributes. *Formal* definition.
        - Inference Rules for MVDs: Similar to Armstrong's axioms, but for MVDs.
        - Relationship to FDs: Every FD is an MVD, but not vice versa.
    - Fourth Normal Form (4NF): BCNF and for every non-trivial MVD X →→ Y, X is a superkey. Eliminates redundancy due to multivalued dependencies. *Formal* definition. Decomposition into 4NF.
    - Join Dependencies (JDs):
        - Definition: A constraint that requires a relation to be equal to the join of its projections. *Formal* definition.
        - Relationship to MVDs: Every MVD is a JD, but not vice versa.
    - Fifth Normal Form (5NF) / Project-Join Normal Form (PJ/NF): A relation is in 5NF if and only if every join dependency in R is implied by the candidate keys of R. Eliminates redundancy due to join dependencies. *Formal* definition. Difficult to achieve and understand in practice.
    - Domain-Key Normal Form (DK/NF):
        - Definition: A relation is in DK/NF if every constraint on the relation is a logical consequence of the domain constraints and the key constraints. The "ultimate" normal form.
        - Ideal, but Impractical: DK/NF is a theoretical ideal, but it is generally not achievable in practice.
- 1.2.4 Limitations of Normalization:
    - Performance Trade-offs: Highly normalized schemas can lead to more joins, which can decrease query performance.
    - Complexity: Designing and understanding highly normalized schemas can be complex.
    - Denormalization: Intentionally introducing redundancy to improve performance. Techniques and considerations.
    - Not Always Desirable: Situations where normalization might *not* be the best approach (e.g., data warehousing, read-heavy applications).

1.3 Database Design and Constraints:

- 1.3.1 Advanced Constraint Types:
    - Inclusion Dependencies (INDs): Specifying that the values in one set of attributes must be a subset of the values in another set of attributes (generalization of foreign keys). *Formal definition.*

    - Active Databases: Database systems that incorporate triggers or other active rules.
- 1.3.3 View Updates:
    - The View Update Problem: The problem of determining how to translate updates on a view into updates on the underlying base tables.
    - Conditions for View Updatability: Not all views are updatable. Specific conditions must be met for a view to be updatable (e.g., the view must be defined on a single table, it must include the primary key of the base table, it must not use aggregation or grouping). *Formal* criteria for updatability.
    - INSTEAD OF Triggers: Using triggers to define custom update behavior for views.

Chapter 2: Transaction Management and Concurrency Control

Goal: To provide a deep and rigorous understanding of transaction management and concurrency control in database systems. This chapter covers the ACID properties, various concurrency control protocols, recovery algorithms, and advanced transaction models, with a strong emphasis on formal definitions, correctness proofs, and performance analysis.

2.1 ACID Properties: Formal Definitions and Implications

- 2.1.1 Transactions:
    - Definition: A logical unit of work that accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. A sequence of read and write operations.
    - Transaction Boundaries: BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.
    - Transaction States: Active, partially committed, committed, failed, aborted.
    - Formal Models of Transactions: Representing transactions as sequences of operations, read sets, write sets.
- 2.1.2 Atomicity:
    - Definition: All operations of a transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations are performed successfully, or none are (all-or-nothing semantics).
    - Implementation: Using logging (write-ahead logging), shadow paging, or other recovery mechanisms.
    - Formalization: Defining atomicity in terms of histories (sequences of operations).
- 2.1.3 Consistency:
    - Definition: A transaction must transform the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. Consistency is defined by integrity constraints (e.g., key constraints, foreign key constraints, check constraints).
    - Application Responsibility: Consistency is primarily the responsibility of the application programmer (who defines the transactions) and the database designer (who defines the integrity constraints). The DBMS ensures that transactions are executed in a way that preserves consistency.
    - Formalization: Defining consistency using integrity constraints and pre- and post-conditions of transactions.
- 2.1.4 Isolation:
    - Definition: Transactions execute as if they were running in isolation from each other, even if they are running concurrently. This prevents interference between transactions.
    - Serializability: The gold standard for isolation. A schedule is serializable if its effect is equivalent to some serial execution of the transactions.
        - Conflict Serializability: A schedule is conflict serializable if it can be transformed into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations. *Formal definition* of conflicting operations (read-write, write-write).
        - View Serializability: A weaker form of serializability. A schedule is view serializable if it is view equivalent to some serial schedule. *Formal definition* of view equivalence.
        - Relationship between Conflict and View Serializability: Every conflict-serializable schedule is view-serializable, but not vice versa. View serializability is NP-complete to test, while conflict serializability can be tested in polynomial time.
    - Weaker Levels of Isolation: Allowing some degree of non-serializable behavior to improve performance.
        - Read Committed: A transaction only reads data that has been committed by other transactions. Prevents dirty reads.
        - Repeatable Read: A transaction is guaranteed to see the same values for a data item if it reads it multiple times within the same transaction. Prevents non-repeatable reads.
        - Snapshot Isolation: Each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database, as of the time the transaction started. Can lead to write skew anomalies.
        - Serializable (Strict): The highest level of isolation, providing full serializability.
    - Anomalies: Problems that can occur when isolation is not enforced.
        - Dirty Read: A transaction reads data that has been written by another transaction, but not yet committed.
        - Non-Repeatable Read: A transaction reads the same data item multiple times and gets different values because another transaction has modified it.
        - Phantom Read: A transaction executes a query multiple times and gets different sets of tuples because another transaction has inserted or deleted tuples that satisfy the query's predicate.
        - Write Skew: Two transactions read overlapping data, make updates based on those reads, and then commit, leading to an inconsistent state (even though each individual write might seem valid).
    - Formal Definitions of Isolation Levels Using histories and precedence graphs.
- 2.1.5 Durability:
    - Definition: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive even system failures (e.g., power outages, crashes).
    - Implementation: Using logging (write-ahead logging) or other recovery mechanisms.
    - Formalization: Guarantees about committed transactions in the presence of failures.

2.2 Concurrency Control Protocols

- 2.2.1 Two-Phase Locking (2PL):
    - Definition: A concurrency control protocol that ensures serializability by requiring that each transaction acquire all its locks before releasing any locks.
    - Phases:
        - Growing Phase: The transaction acquires locks.
        - Shrinking Phase: The transaction releases locks.
    - Lock Types: Shared locks (read locks), exclusive locks (write locks). Compatibility matrix.
    - Variants:
        - Basic 2PL: No restrictions on when locks are acquired or released, as long as all locks are acquired before any are released. Can lead to deadlock.
        - Strict 2PL: Holds all exclusive locks until the transaction commits or aborts. Avoids cascading aborts.
        - Rigorous 2PL: Holds all locks (shared and exclusive) until the transaction commits or aborts.
    - Proof of Serializability: Showing that any schedule produced by 2PL is conflict-serializable. Using precedence graphs.
    - Deadlock: A situation where two or more transactions are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release locks.
        - Deadlock Prevention: Techniques for preventing deadlock (e.g., requiring all locks to be acquired in a specific order, using timeouts).
        - Deadlock Detection: Periodically checking for cycles in a wait-for graph.
        - Deadlock Resolution: Breaking the deadlock by aborting one or more transactions.
    - Performance Considerations: Lock contention, overhead of lock management.
- 2.2.2 Timestamp Ordering (TO):
    - Definition: A concurrency control protocol that uses timestamps to order transactions and ensure serializability. Each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp when it starts.
    - Basic TO:
        - Rules: Transactions are executed in timestamp order. A read operation is allowed if the data item was last written by a transaction with an earlier timestamp. A write operation is allowed if the data item was last read and written by transactions with earlier timestamps.
        - Read Timestamp (RTS): The timestamp of the last transaction that read a data item.
        - Write Timestamp (WTS): The timestamp of the last transaction that wrote a data item.
    - Multiversion TO (MVTO): Maintaining multiple versions of data items, each with a write timestamp. Allows for greater concurrency by allowing reads to access older versions.
    - Comparison with 2PL: TO avoids deadlock, but can lead to starvation. 2PL can provide higher concurrency in some cases, but is susceptible to deadlock.
    - Thomas' Write Rule: Optimization to ignore obsolete write operations.
- 2.2.3 Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC):
    - Definition: A concurrency control protocol that assumes that conflicts between transactions are rare. Transactions proceed without acquiring locks, and conflicts are checked at commit time (validation phase).
    - Phases:
        - Read Phase: The transaction reads data and performs its operations.
        - Validation Phase: The transaction checks if its read set has been modified by other transactions.
        - Write Phase: If the validation succeeds, the transaction writes its changes to the database.
    - Read Set: The set of data items read by a transaction.
    - Write Set: The set of data items written by a transaction.
    - Validation Techniques: Timestamp-based validation, version-based validation.
    - Advantages: Avoids locking overhead, can provide high concurrency when conflicts are rare.
    - Disadvantages: Can lead to starvation if conflicts are frequent, wasted work (aborted transactions).
- 2.2.4 Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC):
    - Definition: A concurrency control protocol that combines aspects of timestamp ordering and optimistic concurrency control. Maintains multiple versions of data items, each with a timestamp.
    - Key Idea: Readers never block writers, and writers never block readers (except briefly when creating a new version).
    - Read Operations: A read operation accesses the most recent version of a data item that was committed before the transaction's start timestamp.
    - Write Operations: A write operation creates a new version of a data item with the transaction's timestamp.
    - Snapshot Isolation: A common implementation of MVCC. Each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database, as of the time the transaction started.
    - Garbage Collection: Periodically removing old versions that are no longer needed.
    - Advantages: High concurrency, reduced locking overhead, supports time-travel queries (accessing older versions of data).
    - Disadvantages: Increased storage overhead (due to multiple versions), complexity of implementation.
- 2.2.5. Index Locking:
    - Phantom Problem: Revisited.
    - Predicate Locking: Locking logical predicates.
    - Key-Range Locking: Used in B-trees.
- 2.2.6 Granularity of Locking
    - Trade-offs: Fine-grained locking (e.g., row-level) allows more concurrency but has higher overhead. Coarse-grained locking (e.g., table-level) has lower overhead but reduces concurrency.
    - Lock Escalation: Dynamically adjusting lock granularity.

2.3 Recovery Algorithms

- 2.3.1 Log-Based Recovery:
    - Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): The principle that all changes to the database must be recorded in a log *before* they are applied to the database. Ensures durability and atomicity.
    - Log Records: Records of changes made by transactions. Types of log records:
        - Start Transaction: Marks the beginning of a transaction.
        - Update: Records the old and new values of a data item.
        - Commit: Marks the successful completion of a transaction.
        - Abort: Marks the failure of a transaction.
        - Checkpoint: Records information about the current state of the database.
    - Log Sequence Numbers (LSNs): Unique, monotonically increasing numbers assigned to log records.
    - Redo Logging: Reapplying updates from the log to ensure that committed transactions are reflected in the database.
    - Undo Logging: Reversing the updates of uncommitted transactions to ensure atomicity.
    - ARIES Recovery Algorithm: (See 2.3.2)
- 2.3.2 ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics):
    - Overview: A widely used recovery algorithm that combines write-ahead logging, repeating history during redo, and logging changes during undo.
    - Key Concepts:
        - Log Sequence Numbers (LSNs): Used to track the order of log records and to identify the state of the database.
        - Dirty Page Table: Tracks which pages in the buffer pool have been modified but not yet written to disk.
        - Transaction Table: Tracks the status of active transactions.
    - Phases:
        - Analysis Phase: Scans the log forward from the last checkpoint to determine which transactions were active at the time of the crash and which pages were dirty.
        - Redo Phase: Repeats history by redoing all updates from the log, starting from the earliest LSN of a dirty page. Ensures durability.
        - Undo Phase: Undoes the updates of uncommitted transactions, working backward from the end of the log. Ensures atomicity.
    - Physiological Redo: Redo operations are logical (describing the change) but applied to specific physical pages.
    - Optimizations: Fuzzy checkpointing, logical undo.
- 2.3.3 Shadow Paging:
    - Definition: A recovery technique that maintains two page tables: a current page table and a shadow page table. Updates are made to the shadow page table, and the current page table is atomically switched to the shadow page table when the transaction commits.
    - Advantages: Simple to implement, avoids logging (in its basic form).
    - Disadvantages: Can lead to fragmentation, not suitable for large databases, does not support concurrent transactions well.
- 2.3.4 Checkpointing:
    - Definition: Periodically flushing dirty pages from the buffer pool to disk and recording information about the current state of the database in the log.
        - Purpose: To reduce the amount of work that needs to be done during recovery.
        - Techniques:
            - Full Checkpointing: Flushing *all* dirty pages.
            - Fuzzy Checkpointing (Incremental Checkpointing): Flushing only some dirty pages, allowing for more frequent checkpoints with less disruption.

2.4 Distributed Transaction Management

- 2.4.1 Two-Phase Commit (2PC):
    - Definition: Protocol for ensuring atomic commitment of transactions in a distributed system.
    - Coordinator and Participants: Coordinator manages commit process, participants are individual database systems.
    - Phases:
    - Prepare Phase: Coordinator asks participants if they are ready to commit. Participants vote "yes" or "no".
    - Commit Phase: If all participants vote "yes", the coordinator instructs all participants to commit. Otherwise, the coordinator instructs all participants to abort.
    - Handling Failures: Using timeouts and log records to handle coordinator and participant failures.
    - Limitations: Blocking protocol (participants can be blocked waiting for the coordinator), can be slow.
- 2.4.2 Three-Phase Commit (3PC):
    - Definition: A non-blocking commit protocol designed to address the blocking problem of 2PC.
    - Phases: Prepare, Pre-Commit, Commit.
    - Advantages: Non-blocking (in the absence of total failures).
    - Disadvantages: More complex than 2PC, higher message overhead.
- 2.4.3 Paxos and Raft for Consensus:
    - Using consensus algorithms to achieve distributed agreement on transaction commit/abort decisions. (Detailed treatment in Chapter 5 of Concurrency & Parallel Computing)

2.5 Advanced Transaction Models

- 2.5.1 Nested Transactions:
    - Definition: Allowing transactions to be composed of subtransactions. Provides a hierarchical structure for transactions.
    - Advantages: Improved modularity, finer-grained control over concurrency and recovery.
    - Implementation: Using nested locks and logs.
- 2.5.2 Long-Duration Transactions:
    - Challenges: Traditional ACID transactions are not well-suited for long-duration activities (e.g., workflows, design processes). Locking resources for long periods can reduce concurrency.
    - Techniques: Sagas, compensating transactions, optimistic concurrency control.
- 2.5.3 Real-Time Transactions:
    - Definition: Transactions with timing constraints (deadlines).
    - Challenges: Scheduling transactions to meet deadlines, ensuring predictability.
    - Techniques: Priority-based scheduling, optimistic concurrency control with deadline-based validation.

Chapter 3: Distributed and Parallel Databases

Goal: To provide a deep and rigorous understanding of the principles, architectures, and techniques used in distributed and parallel database systems. This chapter covers data distribution, distributed query processing, distributed transaction management, parallel query processing, and advanced topics in distributed database design.

3.1 Distributed Database Architectures

- 3.1.1 Introduction and Motivation:
    - Definition: A distributed database is a collection of multiple, logically interrelated databases distributed over a computer network.
    - Motivation: Scalability (handling large data volumes and high query loads), availability (data remains accessible even if some nodes fail), geographical distribution, data locality, organizational structure.
    - Challenges: Increased complexity (data distribution, distributed query processing, distributed transaction management), communication overhead, data consistency, heterogeneity.
    - Transparency: Hiding the distributed nature of the database from users and applications (to varying degrees). Types of transparency: location, fragmentation, replication, access.
- 3.1.2 Architectural Models:
    - Client-Server: Clients access data from a central server (or a set of servers). Can be two-tier or three-tier. Simpler to implement, but the server can be a bottleneck.
    - Peer-to-Peer (P2P): All nodes have equal capabilities and responsibilities. No central server. More scalable and resilient, but more complex to manage.
    - Federated Databases: Integrating multiple autonomous database systems into a single logical view. Allows for data sharing and interoperability between different databases.
    - Cloud Databases: Databases hosted and managed in the cloud. Benefits: scalability, elasticity, pay-as-you-go pricing. Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Spanner.
    - Shared-Memory, Shared-Disk, Shared-Nothing: Distinctions based on how resources are shared among processors.
- 3.1.3 Data Fragmentation, Replication, and Allocation:
    - Fragmentation: Dividing a relation into smaller fragments that are stored at different sites.
        - Horizontal Fragmentation: Dividing a relation into subsets of tuples (rows). Based on a selection predicate.
        - Vertical Fragmentation: Dividing a relation into subsets of attributes (columns). Based on attribute usage patterns.
        - Mixed (Hybrid) Fragmentation: Combining horizontal and vertical fragmentation.
        - Derived Horizontal Fragmentation: Partitioning one relation based on the fragmentation of another.
        - Correctness Rules of Fragmentation: Completeness, Reconstruction, Disjointness.
    - Replication: Storing copies of data at multiple sites.
        - Advantages: Increased availability, improved performance (read operations can be served locally), reduced network latency.
        - Disadvantages: Increased storage cost, update propagation complexity, maintaining consistency.
        - Synchronous Replication: Updates are applied to all replicas before the transaction commits. Provides strong consistency, but can be slow.
        - Asynchronous Replication: Updates are applied to replicas asynchronously. Provides higher performance and availability, but can lead to eventual consistency.
        - Master-Slave Replication: One replica is designated as the master and handles all updates.
        - Multi-Master Replication: Multiple replicas can accept updates. Requires conflict resolution mechanisms.

        - Confidence: The probability that a transaction contains itemset Y, given that it contains itemset X.
        - Lift: A measure of the strength of an association rule, taking into account the support of the individual itemsets.
    - Algorithms:
        - Apriori Algorithm: A classic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets. Uses the "apriori principle" (any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent). *Detailed explanation of the algorithm and its complexity.*
        - FP-Growth Algorithm: A more efficient algorithm that uses a frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) to represent the data.
    - Constraint-Based Association Rule Mining
- 5.3.5 Regression:
    - Definition: Predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
    - Techniques:
        - Linear Regression: Fitting a linear equation to the data. Ordinary least squares.
        - Polynomial Regression: Fitting a polynomial equation to the data.
        - Support Vector Regression (SVR):
        - Other Regression Techniques: (Mentioned briefly, as they're likely covered in ML chapters)
- 5.3.6. Sequence Mining: Finding temporal patterns in sequential data.
- 5.3.7 Text Mining: Extracting knowledge from text data.
